    "\n",
    "However, in this analysis we will not use the Yelp-supplied \"categories\" to cluster for similarity as we did in Part 1. Instead, we will cluster the reviews themselves, extracting categories in an unsupervised fashion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you are to use Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) on the Yelp reviews to cluster restaurants based off on their reviews. As a reminder, LSA consists of using PCA applied to the document-term matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, your feature vectors will contain latitude, longitude and the most relatively important review terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will apply PCA 3 times. Each time, you will take into account the first $k$ reviews per business, where $k = \\{10,100,1000\\}$. Many businesses will have less than $k$, or even no reviews. In this case, simply assign to the business the maximum number of reviews it has.\n",

Since that first we have tried it four more times.  The service and the food have been a big disappointment.  On the last visit I had to return my burger because it was not cooked.  When they brought it back it had an unusual odor but I ate it anyway.  Sick for three days.  Great location but we wont eat here again.', \"So I took my daughter there for breakfast and some practice. Eaten at this place before and it was good. Service was decent.  Waitress says cooks not here he is late. I asked if she has apple juice and ice tea, apple juice for my daughter. She shot me a look and in a dismissive voice says we don't have any.

Beer selection good. Music playlist is annoying at best. Fix the playlist and you get more stars from me.', \"There is nothing more relaxing then looking over a golf course while enjoying lunch. The Flight Decks' location across Las Vegas Blvd from Town Square gives the added bonus of a Strip view. With an impressive menu which boasts a wonderful array of outside the box appetizers like fried green tomatoes and gourmet burgers & sandwiches, plus breakfast selections all day, I would like this newer eatery to remain my own secret dining spot, but I am certain it won't be hidden away for much longer.

The kitchen here is something else!\\n\\nTheir \"Flight Deck Lager\" is a draft beer made for Taylor Made by Anheuser-Busch, and is similar to a Cass or OB beer but a bit lighter, with a clean aftertaste. It\\'s $3/pint all day long.\\n\\nGreat, friendly service every time. And a bright, airy, north-facing environment with a horizonal view of the Strip and plenty of HDTVs, this is a *perfect* starting point for any bachelor, bachelorette or reunion weekend.

They also have a plethora of chips to choose from. \\n\\nOverall clean, good quick eats, will be back again and again.', 'Very rude.  I ordered 2 children sandwich meals.  My children are diabetic. I did not want milk as a drink.  I wanted water.  So he charged me for 2 water cups.  He told me he was giving me a cup, buthe was charging me for tap water.

Then he had a problem with my coupon for the free coupons for filling out a survey.  \\nWhat i would like to have then option of water, tap or a bottle water. So if you want tap water, be willing to pay.  Or if willing to have a whiney child, they will substitute a cookie for a milk without a problem. Uneven treatment of guest.

I think this is a great safety precaution for any 24 hour business and its nice to know the owner cares about their staff.\\n\\nI do not like that they are always out of stuff when I come after 9PM. It is always stuff I'm really craving too! Like pickles, or avocados, or tuna. I definitely think for a location that has to be open 24 hours they should stock better and help set their employees up for a successful night.\\n\\nOver all not the worst Subway I have ever been too.

      "[\"The Town Square shopping center is a pretty interesting place because the mix of shops & activities is good for locals & tourists.  The wait at Brio on Mother's Day was 90 minutes, so GameWorks provided a much-needed distraction for Baby C.  Hat tip to Phil T for mentioning this place.  Otherwise, I would have never known about it.\\n\\nI noticed a few games were straight-up imports from Japan, and other games that I had never seen anywhere else, such as Kung-Fu Panda (so much fun), Transformers and Mario Kart.  There's the usual skee-ball, and some air hockey games as well.  I paid an absurd amount of $ for Baby C to get candy and some water gun made in Taiwan, but that's not the point.  The point is 90 minutes went by pretty quickly, and Baby C was totally entertained.  Not entirely happy about paying a deposit for a card, since I gave it back to GameWorks at the end of the day.  But it's Vegas, so you're not even thinking about it.\", 'Horrible service...Disgusting food...prices are crazy for the small portion they serve you.', \"This place has great discounts on drinks and appetizers most likely to drive business. $3.50 wells and beers such as Stella Artois are a win! My friends ordered nachos but they didn't look like they liked them much. Bartender as others are saying did seem slower. \\n\\nIn terms of an arcade venue, the space is massive and seems like they devoted too much room for restaurant as opposed to adding more games; possibly a bigger bowling alley with more lanes. I did not get to check out the LAN they had setup; next time!\", 'Been to this place twice to eat and play the games.  The game part is fine my issue is with the service with food, first of all the menu is weak , selections of food are poor the salads are gross more lettuce than meat.  The second time we came i thought my meal was better than the first time I came however the waiter was horrible hardly came over to the table we sat for 15mins waiting for another drink and another 15 mins for silverware. Then we just wanted our bill and this guy was no where to be found.   Obviously I should learn but my two first choices of where to eat had no availability .   I will try My hardest not to come back here.   And if a manager reads this. Have yr staff get it together.', 'Dante is the man. Knowledgeable, helpful, and overall cool guy. Go here for all your gaming needs and questions.', 'We had a work party in the e sports area. The staff were extremely helpful and so easy to work with in planning and when we arrived. The place was festive and most importantly the food and drink was good and plentiful.\\n\\nOur average age is 40 and everyone had a blast. Some people were playing games for the first time and the staff made sure they learned how to use the controls in a fun and patient way.\\n\\nWe had a last minute conflict so our numbers were suddenly fewer than expected but they worked with us and we were very happy with how the party turned out.\\n\\nWe will return!', \"There is bowling here. It's not bad, enough space for the families to sit around and hang out. The downfall, there was no one working at the bar within the bowling area. Made it difficult for everyone to look after their belongings and children while ordering food and drinks. lol. Enjoy the ugly neon shoes.  \\n\\nI did however like the pretzels with spicy cheese dip. \\n\\nHighlight: the photobooth.  Spend forever personalizing your photos.  Fun!\", \"We walk in and meet a nice lady where we buy the card with credits. First game we play and it takes our 9 credits and doesn't work. Well that was great. Credits do cost money it's not like we were on some play for so many hours thing. Things were pretty cool from there until we got to the giant fish reel. The reel says we won 70 tickets awesome, the box even says we were awarded 70. So of course since 70 is a lot lets play again. This time the giant reel says we won 60 tickets! Child is super excited and I look down at the box and it says 15 tickets awarded. WHAT?! So I got robbed of 9 credits and at least 45 tickets. Never thought to watch any of the other times we won tickets so who knows how many Game Works really stole from us. It was over all a good time, just left a bad feeling knowing we got ripped off.\", 'Facility is similar to a Dave and Busters but with a larger arcade area and a bar instead of restaurant.\\n\\nGames: Okay selection. Typical games like carnival style, ticket winning games, arcade racing, two rhythm and very few Japanese games. My personal favorite is Taiko Drum Master. Some o the games are rather old and as maintain as other places.\\n\\nPeople: For families and children. The kids could be worst and parents have them in line as best they can. Something about the place and the energy causes the parents to be very impatient and irrational.  Probably some kids are pestering their parents and they are at their wits end. The parents are only interested with their kids and they will interrupt your game if their kids want to play. Teenagers are just as bad. \"Every man from himself\" is what this place is like. That happen twice in one visit.\\n\\n(Specific example, we waited in like for about 1/2-1hr for a game. Then a parent interrupted us when we were playing the game in the beginning and we were like fine. After a while we left and came back. Then we played again after waiting in line for [1/2-1hr] not interrupting the previous player but someone ask us to leave again.)\\n\\nArcade is for family which is great but the parents aren\\'t gamers and have zero gaming etiquette.\\n\\nStaff: Attentive and do what they must. About what you expect.\\n\\nCome here if you have children. Maybe if you want to go from machine to machine. Not if you want to progress in the game or beat it.', \"How disappointing! I probably will not come back to this GameWorks. Half the games were out of order, the place smelled really gross, and it is relatively small compared to Dave and Buster's. The staff is great but when you come to an arcade, you probably expect most of the machines to work.\\n\\nI don't recommend.\", 'Had a blast with the girls today. Used my gift card that I purchased from a fundraiser for 2 hrs of swipe and play. The only thing that irritated me was that every time i swiped.. I had to wait like a few min to be able to swipe again at another game! I will be back to use the other Card i have with my girls!! \\n\\n**Suggestion** Please include cell phone charging station. --thank you :)', \"I was honestly surprised at how much fun we had here. We came by for a late lunch on a weekday and it was almost empty and devoid of small children. We sat at the bar and ordered an Irish Mai Tai (has beer in it) and a blackberry Moscow Mule. They weren't exactly stellar cocktails, but they were tasty enough. On the menu are several items where, if you order them, you can opt to pay more and get a 1-hour game card. This seemed like a great deal. We opted for the nachos, which were priced at $12. By paying $14.99, instead of $12, we got a game card for all the games letting us play whatever we wanted for 1-hr. The one catch is that you can't earn tickets when playing with a timeframe card. But you definitely get a lot more play for you money. The nachos were pretty good. Standard bar fare. The selection of games was pretty good, including some unique ones we'd never seen before. In addition to skee ball and some of the other usual suspects, there was also a motion roller coaster ride and a 4D scary shooting game one. In sum, we had a great time and will be back for more fun.\", 'The games are lots of fun, but the food is terrible and service worse. Come for the games go elsewhere for food', 'I had lots of fun here And I truly felt like a kid again! The things that bugged me is that it is very pricey and the tickets compared to the prizes is very expensive! Something I can purchase at the store for maybe $10 cost 1000 tickets or maybe $50 of hard work gaining the tickets. So with that being said if you are in it for the fun and ready to spend lots of money then have at it! The service though was great!', \"Grat for all ages.... Brings me back to the good old days with some games. Had a blast. And they have a bar with food and a lot of tv's. Will bring my kids n family here\", \"GameWorks is one of my favorite places to go if I want a fun, casual evening with friends. I definitely enjoy playing Skee Ball, air hockey, and other arcade games while having an adult beverage. It's like Chuck E. Cheese for adults, except there are also kids too. Because there are kids, you probably shouldn't try to get tanked here, but they don't create a distraction or prevent adults from having a good time. There's a solid variety of games for all tastes.\\n\\nThe food is equal to above average bar food, which is fine by my standards. The real reason for ordering food is so I can get the Dine & Play combo, the best deal by far. The combo lets you get certain entrees plus a one hour ($15.99) or two hour ($21.99) game card. I'd pay those prices merely for the card, so throwing in an entree on top makes the combo a great deal. It's much cheaper than paying the cash rate. The game card doesn't let you earn tickets, but you can still play most of the ticket games without earning. I don't care about winning a stuffed bear, so that's not a problem.\\n\\nDrink a beer. Kill some zombies. Race a motorcycle.\", 'Had a great time. A friend of mine came with me along with my 3 God kids. Did the 2 hour special on card with one entree (pizza) for $23 bucks. Not bad, considering I let the kids share the card instead of buying them there own card with limited amount of credits; which in my opinion is more expensive. Food wasnt amazing but wasnt terrible either. Had a lot of cool stuff like a separate bowling alley and a separate video game console area to play pc/video games - that however isnt part of the gaming card deal and you have to pay $5 per person per hour FYI. Someone gave us their all day pass because they were leaving so the kids got to play longer. We did leave and did the pay it forward thing to and gave the card to someone else to utitlize as well. Would love to see more old school arcade games as well as more games in general. Typical arcade games that could be found at Dave n Busters, Chuck E Cheese, etc.', \"Very very meh. My son wanted to leave before I asked him too. At least 7 games didn't work, weren't turned on or had bad joysticks or bad calibration. The ticket basketball game started but didn't have any basketballs!!! \\n\\nThe selection of games is very poor. They had several riding/driving games. And they were the standard run of the mill fast and the furious type. There was one that the steering wheel was stuck and we couldn't play it because we couldn't steer. Wasted money on that one. The other ones we played the steering was too loose and you ended up all over the place but not on the course. \\n\\nThe only race game worth it was Mario Kart. \\n\\nThere was three fighting games. Tekken was good as always. Marvel vs Capcom machine was shot. The screen was messed up and couldn't be played. Didn't even get to play. Street Fighters joysticks were busted and couldn't be used to do anything but random forward and back. \\n\\nPinball machines were meh. Ghostbusters was the highlight here. The Game of Thrones one was missing it's glass panel where the artwork goes. \\n\\nThe hunting shooting games didn't seem calibrated. Also we inserted our cards in the cabella big game hunt game and the system rebooted and we lost our credits. Just walked away from that one. \\n\\nThe Star Wars flight simulator thing was pretty bad ass. Me and my some both like it. He was shocked that when you take off a little puff and wind hits ur face.\", 'Pretty meh food and service.  My girlfriend and I went for food and had a Town Square gift card.  We asked three employees if it was accepted there because it\\'s not accepted at some locations like Fry\\'s or Whole Foods.  Every one of them said \"I\\'m not sure but we should take it\" rather than go find a manager and find out.\\n\\nAnyway we sat down and the waitress (Erika I think) came over to get drink orders.  I ordered a water and she thought I ordered a latte.  My girlfriend ordered a diet coke and the waitress said \"Is diet coke OK?\"  :(\\n\\nDrinks come in the smallest glasses I\\'ve ever seen at a restaurant.  My girlfriend orders the pepperoni pizza and I order the steak frites.  It takes a bit too long to arrive, but it finally does.  There is no salt, pepper, or ketchup on any table so we have to ask for all of that.  The steak frites is supposed to come with a tangy ketchup but it is not on the plate so I ask the server about it and she says \"Um, we have buffalo sauce but that\\'s for the wings and I don\\'t even think that\\'s very hot personally ha ha ha.\"  I have no idea why she decided to respond to me that way, but whatever.\\n\\nThe fries are OK, the steak is actually pretty good, but my the pizza was very bland and tasteless.  It took way too long to get drink refills, and when we got them the waitress took our straws away and brought us new wrapped straws.  She also tried to pull a plate out from under me as I was still eating something on it.  Finally, at the end of the meal I have my payment card in my hand, all our plates are in front of us with the napkins and utensils on top and the waitress comes by and says \"Oh, do you want some more drinks?\"  No I want to pay and leave!  \\n\\nThe food was overpriced ($17 for the steak frites and $4 for the diet coke!) and not that great, but the service was absolutely awful.  I won\\'t be going back again.', 'You can go through $100 here in no time, the game prices are very high but the place is a lot of fun and the kids love it. Being in a wheelchair the accessibility is not bad at all. I just wish I could transfer into the games with seating easier. Overall a fun higher priced experience for the family.', \"We'll the dang ol bar in the bowling alley is pretty awesome bartender with the red hair think heather be the name just a doll made delicious drinks very knowledgeable fun atmosphere give it a ten don't cha know\", \"Me and a buddy came here cuz we had the same day off to just relax and have some fun. We decided to bowl a couple games. We asked for a waitress to take our food and drinks orders. It took them 15 minutes to send someone. She took out order and it took another 10 minutes to get a soda? Keep in my mind the establishment is empty! We didn't get our food till we were done bowling. I had to have someone go find the waitress. This place is a waste of my money! If I could give it zero starts I would've!\", 'Channon really gave me great service n drinks 2day. Thank you. I just wanted one drink, but her charm and enthusiasm left me with a handful of drinks..', \"Rule #1 Never Come on a weekend\\nRule #2 Expect to wait for a game\\n\\n\\nSo I've been here a few times and I'm a fan. I don't care much for kids so I know not to come during the weekend. I love playing video games and love to drink, I'm in heaven because this place has both. I can't say anything about the food because I've never had it. I can say that the service is either hit or miss, most of the bartenders are really really nice I've had 1 bartender a really pretty asian girl with a bad attitude but other than that I can't complain. I typically have a beer on draft and they are always very cold and the prices aren't bad. I always go for the Groupon special $20 for the all day pass because I could spend Hours playing games. Keep in mind that Game Works is not a big place so Yes you will have to wait for a game or two. This is a great place to come during the week and kill some time while having a few cold ones.\", \"Just witnessed the manager yelling at a bunch of customers. This is supposed to be a family freandly place. Im now no longer comfortable coming here. My children don't need to hear this!!\", \"It's a nice addition to Town Square but VERY pricey.  Not enough actual arcade games. And some are already broken or not working yet. Bar and restaurant area is too big, takes up half of the place. Bowling is $5 per game and $4 for shoes. Needs a lot of work to get out all the kinks to make this a great local spot.\", 'Smaller than expected it to be. Not really wowed. There was a bar, which is a plus. But for a Saturday night.. The bar was completely understaffed. This is probably the longest I had to wait for a drink. Which made me a little irritated. Pricing was not bad compared to other places on the strip. Decor is very nice... But they need to staff accordingly!!!!! Not as many games as the previous GAMEWORKS in Vegas. The bathrooms were a little dirty as well. I would come back to see if this would change.', \"I have to admit.. I'm a huge critic on servers reason being because I serve tables and train them also.. ebony blew me away with her outgoing and friendly personality when I asked her about things on the menu . She made my kids laugh and when I asked for something with no hesitation she was on it. This is the type of sever we need in vegas.. the ones that make you feel welcome to be there. I will most definitely be back.. thank you so much ebony..\", \"The arcade in Gameworks has a lot of variety it seems like a very fun atmosphere you get good credits and enough to play almost every game once for $20 so this I really enjoy.\\nAs for Gameworks food... They have horrible service. I ordered three separate items and out of the three separate items I received only two then on top of all of that they didn't give me any napkins,ketchup or any other condiments the table was completely blank I didn't get my napkins until I was halfway through my food and the waitress saw that my hands were greasy. Overall Gameworks is a good arcade place but I as for the food service They should really pay a lot of attention to it.if Gameworks wants to compete with Dave and busters they they are very low on that totem pole they need a lot of work.\", 'If you are looking for something new and different to do, you have to come here!! They have all types of arcade games for reasonable prices. \\n\\nUpon entering, you load a Gameworks card which will cost you a one time $2 fee. Then, you can add points into the card. The deal I purchased was 120 points for $22. \\n\\nOn Tuesdays they have double ticket earnings which is a great deal! I enjoyed playing everything from ski ball to Mario kart to pinball and basketball. They offer so many classic arcade games for few points. Ski ball was only 2 points per turn so you can imagine how far your $22 go. Plus, you received so many tickets for playing that the prizes to choose from at the end were not just limited to candy.', \"The kids wanted to meet up and hang out with some of their friends so this is place they chose. The games could use some updating, but the air hockey table was where they spent most of there time! This was not your average air hockey table. This was air hockey on steroids. At different times like 20 small pucks would slide down on the table and it was a blast seeing the kids faces light up with excitement! \\nWe got here a bit late so we didn't get to try the food, but looking at the pics on Yelp, I may just go back for lunch before we leave Vegas. The bar looked pretty cool as well had 2 pool tables in back, but I was with my kids and holding my littlest man man so no adult activities for daddy. Another cool thing about this place is they had a section with some of the classics, Pac Man, Donkey Kong, just to name a few. All and all the kids had a blast even little guy fun on some riding games.\\n\\nAmbiance 3/5\\nFood 0/5 but looking forward to trying \\nDrink 0/5 \\nService 0/5\\nOverall Experience 3/5\\nTill next time Drink, Eat, and Enjoy this life you live - Groux\", \"Pretty cool spot for a night out with friends or a day with the family. There are tons of games, bowling, food and drinks (for the adults ). We have been here a few times and each time of course the kids left very happy (and tired, thankfully). They have games for tickets which can be traded in for prizes in the end as well as a room full of computer/video games. Games for everyone! \\n\\nThey have a few pretty good deals for games only but the one we took advantage of was the unlimited play for an hour with an entree. \\n\\nThere was some miscommunication between how to purchase the deal and we got sent around to 3 different people so that was a bit frustrating. Only other downfall was the service in the restaurant. We waited for almost 10 minutes before anyone came and greeted us or got our drinks, then another 30 minutes for our food. I'm not a master chef but I don't think our nachos, cheese pizza and burger takes that long to prepare. Also, our server was less than attentive. Nonetheless, I know people don't go there for the food its just an added incentive while you are there to play games!!!! \\n\\nCool spot again to drink and play games, maybe dine at another nearby establishment though.\", 'Great place to kill a couple hours for a reasonable price. \\nThe bowling alley was alot of fun and had a really cool vibe with the blacklights and music.\\nThe bar in the bowling alley should be open to make it a little more convenient to order food and drinks.\\nAnd the A/C needs some work, lol.\\nBesides that , a good time !', \"Came here to play some games with friends after walking around town square.

All fun and games, but no food for you.\", \"1 pizza,nachos and 4 drinks...$72! Are you kidding me? The pizza was like the stuff you get in school. Hard cheese and grease floating on top. The service in the restaurant area sucked. I stood by the host table not sure if we ordered there or waited to be seated. All the while,some 16 yr old staring at me not saying one word. Finally I attempt to order and was told I need a table first. Ok cool,but you seen me standing here for 5 min and didn't say a word! Kids eventually had fun on the games you could play (half of them were down). Don't think I'll take the family back anytime soon. Hopefully Dave and Busters is better!\", \"our family  got the groupon with $20 in play and an all day unlimited pass. We had a friend who has a POGO pass to use also.

We normally go to Dave and Buster's and have a blast! 50%  Gameworks games are  broken or aren't working properly in all the times going to Dave and Buster's we only seen one game down and it was repaired within a couple of days. After an hour and half we had played what games we could and were bored.  We didnt even bother  with food because if they cant keep the video games in good shape , i cant imagine what the kitchen looks like!!

Want to thank our host Lorenzo, party coordinators, and Tommy for making it an awesome BDay party. If your kiddo have food sensitivities, this is a place to come for a party.', 'I brought my son and couple of his friends here after for the first time after a movie. When I first walked in I must say it was an impressive sight. Lots of redemption games and the familiar cluster of noises reminded me of that an arcade is supposed to be. \\n\\nBut my son and his friends were more interested in the e-sports room, particularly in Mario Kart on the Wii U. When we found out they hold Mario Kart tournaments he was super excited. But concerned parents BEWARE!!!!!! These events along with many others are hosted by an outside person. So like any responsible parent I did a little research on this person who I will leave anonymous. Although I have had no interactions with this person personally, based on some of the vulgarity he posts on Twitter and watching some of his videos, I do not know how a large company like GameWorks could associate with such a person. He is not only unprofessional on his social media but also has no concern for censoring himself around younger people during hosted events it seems. My son was disappointed when I told him he could not attend any of these events but I feel it\\'s my responsibility as a parent is to not allow him to come to these events based on the personality involved. Perhaps these events are geared more for \"adults\" then it shouldn\\'t be kid games or GameWorks should do a little more research on who they have working for them.', 'My children ask to return to GameWorks each Saturday and Sunday. The weekends are set for fun at GameWorks.', \"Some of the games can get pricey, but it's a great treat for kids off all ages, young to old.

My friend went behind one of the service stations and got us plates & silverware after our pizza had already gotten cold. \\nPizza was so-so , definitely undercooked and super greasy.

Tried to play the game and his machine worked while mine didn't. I had to play on another one so I was basically on the other end. Then we moved over to play the football throwing game and they only had 2 machines. 1 of them didn't work. It started getting irritating. We didn't even use all our credits, we ended up just leaving to walk around the mall. Either take the machines that don't work out or fix them.\", \"If you like food that has no taste and is over priced, this is the place for you. The food was without a doubt the worst food I've ever had. We had a party of 4, one being a child and we didn't even eat half before we thought we was gonna be sick. Save your money, eat Raising Canes and then go to New York New York for the arcade.\", \"My husband and I purchased a great deal from groupon for $20 dollars each for unlimited game playing, but it is only valid on games that to not distribute tickets to redeem prizes. Sometimes the card allows you to play, but won't give you tickets. They had almost every type of game to play such as video old school arcade games,pin ball, virtual racing, air hockey, bowling, live xbox, pool table, basket ball shooting, etc...they also have a restaurant and bar. It has plenty seating. This place is good for meeting friends and having drinks. It's crowded during the weekends,but best time to go if you're an adult is Sun-Thurs after kids curfew 10pm. This allows you to play almost all the games, when it's crowded it becomes stuffy and hot, so dress lightly. Food and drinks are inexpensive, no coins are needed, you just buy a preloaded card and play as much as what you purchased. I hadn't had that much fun in years, that it left my hand and arm sore lol! Hats off to them for bringing kids, adults, and families out, and having a fun place to interact.\", \"Came here to check out the venue for a birthday party. However my experience wasn't so great. First off there was no changing table in the family restroom to change both of my sons diapers. Luckily I have my Phil & Teds stroller to convert into a changing table. second of all some of the games here are not well maintained. for instance the basketball hoops the staff does not ensure that each basketball hoops stall has basketballs. Most of the basketballs were gathered into one basketball stall. also the machines that are damaged keep taking the credits from the game card. Thus making it's an inconvenience in having to contact a staff member to reload the credits. I feel this place is not meant for toddlers as there are very little game choices for them.\", \"I love Gameworks!! I had my 10 year olds birthday party here and it was better than I could've ever expected! Our servers Jamie and Ron were very friendly and the games were a huge hit with all the kids! The bar area is a great area for the adults as well all staff (Sam and Andy) were so nice! I would recommend this place to anyone!\", \"This is a decent place. I bought the Groupon that came with the all-day game card and the $10 game card for the ticket games. My husband and I took our four kids.\\n\\nI have to say that the all-day game card isn't really worth it. By two or three hours, you'll probably have had your fill of gaming. The arcade is not really that big. If you're there on a weekend, like we were, you'll have to deal with rude Vegas people cutting in front of you while you're waiting in line for a game. That was not fun. I feel like they could have cut back on the dining area, which seemed empty most of the time, to add more room for arcade games.\\n\\nWe ate dinner there and I thought it was reasonably priced for Vegas (except for the $9 mozzarella sticks). The food was good. \\n\\nThe location adds a lot of value to this place. When my younger kids got bored with games, we were able to go play at the Town Square park. When the whole family was bored, we went and saw a movie at the AMC theater. We had planned to spend the whole day just doing GameWorks, but quickly discovered that it wasn't entertaining enough for an entire day, so I'm glad that we had all the other Town Square options to choose from.\", 'Gameworks. When you hear that it should sound like a dream to everyone. The former Gamewirks that was on the Strip was a wonderful attraction. It had hundreds of games in a large space as well as a rock climbing wall that was transformed into an area for more games. When the original closed in Spring 2012, it was pretty heartbreaking. There were no real arcade places around Las Vegas that was on the level of Gameworks. This new TownSquare Gameworks is a degrader. It\\'s far more smaller which was a huge disappointment. There were a few games that were attractive such as the 3-D zombie game, basketball, football, a fighter jet simulator, a computer gaming area, and the bowling alley. Everything else was more for the younger children running around. There is also a bar for the adults to relax which is nice for them. There is a new \"Recharge Center\" to reload credit into your card which is needed for the games, which is great. Other than that I wish this place was larger and beeds more games.', \"Had my son's 12th birthday party here in February and I must admit, it was excellent service from management to our server who both really made the party a success. We all know when planning a child's party,  everything can go wrong!...really really fast, and it did everyone was wonderful even the bartender in the bowling alley. I promise you'd love this location well I did and would suggest it to anyone who wants to have a party here, or even just to hang out! I highly recommend it.\", 'I love this place!!  My son (5 yrs old) always has a blast. And, so do we.  There are no tickets or tokens like CEC, just a nifty little Gamecard that you add money to and tracks your points.  Plus, the toys/gifts are 1000 times better than CEC.  I love they have a bar and am always sure to treat myself.  Plus I love that they are in TownSquare so you can make an entire day and have lunch, shop, play, even see a movie.  My only complaint is that we do end losing money in broken games.  It is a little chaotic because they are so busy, but we have always had a good experience regardless because staff is super friendly.', 'When Gameworks first opened I was really disappointed but I have been going more recently and enjoy everything it has become. The food is good and there is a good happy hour during the week. I would like to give a shoutout to Michael for helping me with a problem with my card and recommending some food for my dinner. He helped during a stressful misplacement of my game card which had all my tickets.', 'In my time I\\'ve never seen such a unorganized place. Games are always broken down, card readers have a serious issue of not reading or taking others credits. It\\'s sad when a business like this isn\\'t taking care of their own product. Food is great, the Servers are not. There are a select few servers that have their heads together and ones I do enjoy having around, some even go as far to make the guest feel like they are worth being there which I do Enjoy. Young Lady Sahara she is an outstanding server, Another Alonzo? If i remember right, went as far to make my child birthday a day to remember. None the less the place seems like a cesspool of drama. Bad when you hear the employees talking bad about one another calling each other vulgar names behind their back. that\\'s just sickening and very unprofessional, even worse when the managers don\\'t respond to any calls going out or giving you some BS excuse, Doesn\\'t help looks like a few of them are under the influence of something. These are things that make me wonder why is this place still running or why haven\\'t they got a change of people. You walk in the place, you can feel that there is something going on, Don\\'t get me started on that Dark Ride game, That was just a huge mistake.\\n\\nWill I be returning here, high chance I will not. Should others be cautious on what\\'s going on there? Yes! Do understand this place is suppose to be family friendly, That place is by far not as \"Family Friendly\" as it seems. Please be aware when you walk into this place, if you have kids and wish to eat, please sit away from the booths.

Thanks for the help Chad!!!  If you have or are a gamer, must check it out. So happy they re-opened in Vegas. Great location at town square!!! GO HAVE A BLAST !!!!!!!', \"GameWorks was an awesome experience for my family and I. We started with delicious,well made Sweet Thai Chicken Sandwiches and the crispy, chicken Tenders as well. The meal took a little while to be served but the service was great. While waiting we realized that the television was uncomfortable to watch at times because the contrast was WAY too high.\\n\\nAfter our meal we bought game cards. First, we had to buy a new card that was $2 and then the actual credits range from ($5-$50) and then if you want to supersize the amount of credits you get, that's an extra $2 dollars as well. The prices of the credits weren't too bad but to actually enjoy yourself, you have to spend at least $20 due to how much credits each game takes. Overall GameWorks is SUPER fun and I'll definitely be back.\", \"I just went last night, after not going since shortly after they opened. This place is pitiful! Many games don't work, and a lot of the seats on the ones that do are disgusting. There are literally huge holes in the seats, where you can see all the filthy foam inside. Less than half of the basketball games were on, and there were only 3 balls in each, so you waste a lot of time waiting for the balls to be returned. A lot of the 2-player shooting games are missing one gun,so you can't play them together. \\n\\nThey finally  got a dark ride, and I have always loved that attraction. It's fun, but too short. I'm glad I got to try it here while it's still new, before it looks like the rest of the building. \\n\\nI'm not sure how this place went down hill so fast, but it looks depressing in there, and it's pretty gross. I probably won't be going back.\", 'Just recently had a holiday party at gameworks and it was great! Thank you Ron Arenas for making this happen! The kids and the adults all had a good time there!', \"Cool place for my 9 year old son. On the pricey side. He was excited, we loaded $20 on his card and he blew through that in less than 45 minutes!

Hosted my son's 6th bday in the cosmic bowling area for 25 - kids & adults. The kids bowled first, since we had to get them shoe'd up, bumpers & smaller-sized bowling balls; we ordered drinks & started snacking, leaving time for the kids to eat after they bowled w/ the adults settled in. The timeline worked out perfect for us. \\n\\nFor food, we went with: \\n- Fresh Fruit Tray -very fresh pineapples, melon, grapes, strawberries & blackberries; this is a huge colorful tray & loved it\\n\\n-Caesar Salad - Crisp with dressing on the side- loved the dressing, was surprisingly tasty as I didn't know what to expect\\n\\n-Baked Ziti -  this was also really surprisingly pleasing & a crowd favorite\\n\\n-Pizzas - I didn't try personally, but the first order was gobbled up so we ordered a second round that was also destroyed\\n\\nOverall, our hosts were super accommodating, worked with us within our budget & even helped us extend our party so that we could open gifts with family after everyone bowled/played in the arcade. A+ service!\\n\\nWe added on the 2 hour game cards. If you rent the bowling area, I'd skip the games. First of all, it's a madhouse & hard to keep track of the little ones. We could have just bowled w/ everyone (disclaimer: because we had so many adults, it was fun for the kids to clear out for awhile so adults had some space to bowl). The timed game cards are confusing- they don't work on many games & no tickets. The solution would be to get the paid game cards that play for tickets. I heard the cocktails were light but wines & beers appeased - I would stick with the mid-level bar tickets over the premium & next time - also comes w/ a variety of soft drinks in the package, refills included.\\n\\nAs far as kids parties go in an arcade setting, I highly recommend. I loved how easy going, yet attentive the planners and staff were. A solid 4.5 kid's party.\", \"This review is strictly for there restaurant I got a undercooked pizza and the taste was awful.

They barely had any good games and is smaller than the original gameworks. They could have fit in more games if they left out the bowling and restaurant area that nobody was using. Oh well...the best game in my opinion was the Family Guy pinball game.', 'If i could submit no stars i would. First, the red headed or pink haired bartender needs to check herself. She showed no hospitality and failed to make an old fashioned cocktail. Barely any whiskey and served in a dirty soda glass. Also while i was trying to enjoy my terribly made drink i could overhear her speaking rudely about me to her coworkers. Girl needs to go.', \"This is for the arcade only I did not eat there so my old review on the pizza is the same.  The arcade was Very clean this time.   Most  of the machines were in working order. Staff was very friendly and responsive when we used  a game that was broken. We went on a dark 3D game which is an additional fee it  was very cool and felt like we got our money's worth.   I saw a big improvement over the last time I was there.   I hope they improved their food and next time I'm there I'll try their kitchen again.\", \"Does management know who their target customer is?  What a disappointment!  Are they a bar or a game/entertainment center? One second they are catering to adults with drinks and low budget tv's and steps away they are catering to 5 year old children. The bar and arcade are a very weird mix in such a small space.  This is a classic example of a jack of all trades, master of none.  If this is a restaurant /bar, there are better ones 25 feet away and if this is an arcade for children, this is Las Vegas and Circus Circus runs circles around it. I expected that this was going to be a very cool, new and innovative arcade center for all ages and was really excited for something new and different to arrive but was disappointed to say the least and would never go back. I could improve this place with my eyes closed.\", \"The new town square location is convenient. I came for Sunday football and met up with some friends, some of whom have children.\\n\\nEach game was prominently displayed. There are not only big flat screens but projector tv's as well. Plus, audio for one game was playing. \\n\\nThe food was typical bar food with wings, fish and chips, salads, calamari, works fries, and overloaded nachos. The portions are also fairly generous. Though there are seemingly more up scale dinners as well like steak or salmon. While I didn't try the attempts at finer food, I question the logic and quality of the ingredients of an arcade which may see someone order salmon once a week.\\n\\nThere's enough to keep the kids entertained so long as it's not busy. The size of the building is comparable to other chains like Dave and Buster's thanks to the bowling alley and private rooms. The designers made an oversized dining and tv watching area that doesn't fit with the number of game machines. If the dining room were packed with parents, the lines for games would be three kids deep. That is to say, there aren't enough game machines if business picks up.\\n\\nAs far as the bar, they do have about ten things on tap including Angry Orchard, Stella, and Sam Adams. I did find it annoying that every time is came back to the bar and the same bartender, she had to check my id. I'm a huge hipster in a hat and bright pink and blue shirt memorable enough for the bar flys to remember what team I was cheering for. I will say on behalf of a few of the girls: avoid the mixed drinks because they're poorly proportioned with too much syrup and for one mojito which was made with gin instead of rum, just wrong.\\n\\nI cannot speak to the bowling or the LAN/internet gaming, but the former was empty and the later seemed packed.\", 'Went visiting some relatives out here in sin city and we decided to take our little cousins somewhere fun! \\n\\n\\nThis place is a treat! They had a great deal going where it was unlimited games for $12.99 (not including the ones that gives tickets) and that was perfect for us. Ended up getting one for each kids and set them loose. Plenty of games to play and they had this esports center that had  game consoles and tons of gaming pcs to play. \\n\\n\\nI also would love to point out the surrounding area had plenty of food options and shops also a movie theatre! Great place to go if you want to escape the craziness of the strip!', \"We had my son Jakes birthday party here, a little costly but worth it. \\nThe girl talking care of the party was slow, and uninterested, not very engaging with the kids, just talked to employees and texted on her cell phone.\\nSharice . \\nThat's the only disappointment since coming here. \\n\\nWe had a great bartender at the party in the bowling room. \\n\\nI've seen the same bartender there everytime I go. \\nHe's African American with a goatie, sit in his section and order a Moscow Mule! \\nI'm a connoisseur of Moscow Mules (lol) and he makes them better than Mandarin Oriental, Wynn, all the top places in Vegas who have them on their specialty menu. \\nThe perfect amount of alcohol to spice, taste incredible!\\n\\nGreat place to let your kids run amuck while you drink at the bar and order food. \\nI definitely recommend this place for birthday parties, regardless of the girl who hosted my sons party. \\nLooking forward for my sons 9th\", \"I want to give this a five star rating based on the games but I can't since their food is awful!

Their eSports employees are all top knotch. When you go in, you're not a customer. You're a member of the team. Everyone has a blast! They host reat tournaments with beyond-fair prize support. As a former LAN-Center manager, I can tell you that this place gets a lot of things right. You can swing by and even watch some of the large tournaments. They recently hosted a Hearthstone Nats Qualifier, League of Legends LCS qualifier, and have nightly tournaments. Specifically, Veronica, Nancy, and Marlon are some of their all-stars. Their team is too fantastic to name them all, but I can not praise them enough. They have become my home away from home.\\n\\n11/10\", 'I chuckled when I saw that this place is categorized on Yelp under \"Gastropubs.\" That\\'s pretty generous.\\n\\nI went to GameWorks for a big group dinnertime outing. We didn\\'t get any special rates, just their Dine & Play combo that\\'s always available. For $14.99, you get one of their time cards loaded for one hour, and one of ten specially labeled items on the menu. It\\'s also possible to do $21.99 for a two-hour card, but nobody chose that option.\\n\\nLike some of the others, I went with the Fish & Chips because it\\'s normally $14.50, which is almost the price of the Dine & Play one-hour deal. I wasn\\'t expecting much, but the cod fillets were reasonably flavorful. It\\'s unfortunate that they seemed a little heavy rather than fluffy, and the batter wasn\\'t as crispy as I\\'d hoped. I chose waffle fries for the side rather than mashed potatoes or salad, neither of which can really be called chips. The fries were decently seasoned and generally had a decent crisp and some fluffiness, but I\\'ve had better.\\n\\nI also sampled the GameWorks Nachos (normally $12) with steak (+$3). I suppose that the meat could be construed as \"ground steak\" instead of ground beef. Nothing in the dish was anything special. I even prefer the TGI Friday\\'s nachos over this.\\n\\nI should note that they handled service for our rather massive table (20+ people) just fine, with constant replacement of water pitchers too, although condiments (notably ketchup for my fries) were a bit delayed.\\n\\nAs for the arcade, I only partook in one round of DDR Supernova 2 because I\\'d handed off my card to a friend while playing pool ($13/hr Sun-Thu 4pm-close, but I think they weren\\'t too strict on the one hour). The pool tables and cues seemed decent enough, although someone noted that one of the rails seemed to be a bit dead. Anyway, from what I saw my friends play, the arcade had a nice selection of shooting games, air hockey, a crazy souped up Pac-Man inspired version of air hockey, some rhythm games, and some racing games. I\\'ve seen worse arcades for sure.\\n\\nI should note that all the TVs were set to the Monday Night football game, with audio available seemingly everywhere in the building. This was fun for casual fans and for vocal Cowboys fans alike. They also have a football game-day food promo that I believe was $35 for a large (16\") one-topping pizza, 35 wings, a pitcher of soda (or +$5 for a pitcher of beer), and one-hour game cards at $5 per person. I also noticed that they offer $10 unlimited gaming on Thursdays 5pm-close and immediately wished that the social had taken place then. Oh well.\\n\\nI don\\'t foresee myself coming back very soon, but GameWorks has some potential appeal for arcade gaming. Just don\\'t expect too much from the food and you\\'ll be fine.', \"Very disappointed with this arcade. Firstly, ALL of the employees are EXTREMELY RUDE! From the door to the exit they make you feel like the hate their job and they don't want you there. They were all young and had a bad attitude. My friend and I encountered 5-6 different employees with the same bad attitude. \\n\\nWe went On a Friday night. A large percentage of their games were broken so my friend and I could hardly play anything together. They had a cool picture booth but that was about it. \\n\\nEven on the game we managed to play together 15 minutes before it closed we had 2 different employees tell us it was closing with an attitude.\\n\\nI never want to go back but I have money left on my card. Hopefully they'll fix some machines and bad attitudes if I ever decide to.\", \"Decided to check Gameworks on their opening day. They were giving out 2 free hour game cards with a purchase of a $12 card (54 credits) because they were experience problems, which is a nice gesture. By problems that meant that half of the games weren't working. I went to the MGM location when it was open and honestly this location doesn't even come close. There are very little games and it doesn't help that most of them were down and the area is really small. Staff is very nice though. Their systems went completely down around 9:30pm and that's when my boyfriend and I decided to leave. \\n\\nWhat this Gameworks has that the old one didn't is an Esports area where you can play PC games like League of Legends and World of Warcraft. I get the concept of this idea, but you can stay home and play these games and this space could've been utilized for more games. \\n\\nI'll give this place another chance when they've had time to straighten out their kinks.\", \"The place is cool, the games are great\\n\\n\\n the food is disgusting\\n\\nThe customer service poor\\n\\n\\nIt is hands-down the worst food I've never ordered. Salty bruschetta, salty disgusting calamari, nachos with nothing on them\\n\\nI've never had worst food served to me on a consistent basis\", 'The first few games we tried had broken controls so we played more of the circus games that you can win tickets to redeem for little trinkets. Those brought back memories of going to the carnival when I was little. My teenage son  decided to go the gaming section which features online computer role playing. the price at 5 per hour seemed very reasonable.  Decided to have lunch at the restaurant. It is inside of Gameworks with open walls so you hear the machines and excitment of kids and adults. There are also multiple tv screens showing various sports programs. The food was pricy for the two items choose, buffalo chicken wrap and fish and chips $25 but it was a decent portion. Just enough to feed three, not so hungry, people. \\nOverall the area was nice and clean. The bathrooms were clean also.', \"Love the LAN gaming section of gameworks! They have all the new generation consoles plus great running PCs for all your online LAN gaming needs!  They serve drinks from the bar inside the gaming lounge which is really convenient. They also have a decent happy hour after 9pm. I usually go with my girlfriend at least once a week we really enjoy it!\\n\\nHaven't used the other part of gameworks at all. Seems like its way to bunched together they need to open up the dining area to more games I never see anyone using the dining room anyways. Just my thoughts!\", '**Birthday Party Review**\\nWe had my sons birthday here today. I would HIGHLY recommend Gameworks as the venue for your next party. While I agree with other reviewers that the food leaves a great deal of room the improvement the party packages and service more than make up for it. My guests had a wonderful time and our host Zach was the greatest! We booked the party mostly by email with Allie and she too was a pleasure to work with. If you are looking for a party venue I highly recommend!', 'I have the best memories with the boyfriend at gameworks. Super fun. Go on Tuesdays for double tickets!', 'Very disappointed with the \"New and Improved\" GameWorks. I do understand it is a smaller location from there last, but its so cramped in there. Usually lines for arcades that dont even work right. Over-priced. Just not a place where I would spend my day with friends.', \"My son had a great time here for his birthday last night! The girls up front were friendly and our waitress was great! Nice place for adults and kids! I didn't give it 5 stars because the games were a bit pricey! We ordered pizzas and were impressed at how good they were!\", \"First time in a long time since I came back to Gameworks. The last time I've been here was when they had one on the strip next to M&M World.  I've seen nothing new except the bowling and they have billards.  It looked similar to Insert Coins.  Because they have a bar and gaming consoles for you to play on too.  I didn't like the new payment method where you have to get a prepaid card to swipe to play a game.  I like the old fashion pay with quarters.  I like they have an internet cafe where you can LAN party with your friends.  All in all, it's not that bad.\", 'I came here with my family on a Saturday. Great place for kids and adults to have a little bit of fun. The staff was friendly and efficient. Also One of the managers Ron was very polite and even went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of. Food was good and there was a great vibe to the place. Definitely a place for all ages', '2 Star rating on average?

The prices are high, the games race car and shooter centric. The kids had a blast running around and playing the games. The Pac-Man air hockey was definitely the crowd favorite though. A mix between hungry hungry hippos and air hockey made for a hectic scavenging mess. It might lead to someone getting a face full of pucks, but it is always worth it to crush your rivals. The fighter jet game in a pod was also quite fun. Otherwise, I tend to go back to the tennis game. \\n\\nBesides the central room; there is a bowling alley, gamer room with computers and gaming systems. I didn't eat, but their drinks are really reasonable. To get a Hendricks and soda or a Bulleit and ginger beer was $16. Maybe I am so used to paying Strip prices, but it just doesn't sound too bad.\", \"Horrible, overpriced, dirty and most of the games are broken. The prizes are not even worth trying to win. The food is discusting aswell. I really expected alot more than this. The old gameworks on the strip was so much better. NEVER stepping foot in this place again and I don't reccomend anyone to stop by here. I thought all these reviews were exaggerating but trust me they are not. I was so dissapointed I left and just went to the NEW YORK NEW YORK Arcade.\", 'I was skeptical about this place at first but I stumbled in to play my friend Jimmy at the basketball game because we wanted to kill some time.

Will definitely be coming back.', 'Came here for the kiddies. Got a groupon deal which was awesome $20 for all day pass and $20 freeplay. Kids had an awesome time. Nice location with many shops in the town square that parents can enjoy while the kids game their brains out. They have a nice little restaurant in the back with a BAR (yeah baby). Win win for all.

Half of the games are out of order or in some kind of disrepair. They only had one Mario kart racing working and the steering was off! There is no tickets on that night which is fine but then half of the games are dumb because the only point of them is getting tickets.  The food and drink is over priced for what you get. The cards suck and you have to swipe them a bunch of times to get them to work. WEAK!', \"This place is absolutely atrocious!!!  It seemed like an arcade graveyard. 50-60% of the games either didn't work, didn't accept the card, or were just plain not on. I saw on at least 3 different occasions where a 2 person shooter game only had 1 gun..  We sat down on another 2 person game, and the start button only worked for one player. The calibrations were off on a couple games (shooting far left, and the crosshairs are all the way over to the right).  The basketball games with their sad, deflated basketballs, with pieces of the ball literally falling off. The one football game that did work, again had sad deflated footballs. However, I did see Tom Brady playing the game, and those deflated footballs really sent him over the top for the high score. This place is literally the biggest joke, and saddest excuse for an arcade that I've ever seen. This is Las Vegas... get your stuff together!  \\n\\nPs...  GameWorks management, don't bother responding to apologize, and urge me to check out your rewards program. We will never set foot in here again. And for the sake of everyone's sanity..  Take your business off of Groupon. You're not set up to be anything more than an old, tired, rundown graveyard for games. Time to close the doors, and replace it with a Dave and Busters.\", \"This place is about 1/3 the size of the old one. Although the location is better.

We had a good time on all the interactive games that were for the most part easy to understand and play for the little ones.  I do think that they could have used a few more pieces of equipment.  I understand that many of these machines cost as much as your moms Hyundai.  These machines are also very tempermental and see nothing but abuse from these super nerds who live in solitarey confinement playing Xbox 360 and only come out for cheesy gordita crucnches from Taco bell and a new Maxim magazine to masturbate to. \\n\\n This is a tough crowd to please.  My suggestion would have been to put in a Jack In the Box for gamer dietary needs, instead of another sub par restaurant with high prices.  This is the last thing Las Vegas needed.  You could have used that huge dining space to put in more revenue..... or credit generators. Gameworks you are located in one of the highest rent districts in all of Las Vegas.

When will I learn to stop holding you to such high, reasonable, expectations...\\n\\nMy first awful experience with this place was back in January of 2015. We went for my little brother\\'s birthday, and he was super excited to win a prize from the arcade. When we told our waiter this, he offered us the all you can play for 2 hours pass, and we thought: \"perfect, we can earn a bunch of tickets and get him something fun!\" It wasn\\'t until the two hours ended and we tried to redeem our tickets that we were informed we did not win any tickets, the pass just gave us unlimited game play. My brother was heartbroken, and we walked out empty handed, and when we complained to the front desk they refused to do anything for us, and told us we should have specifically asked the waiter. What?! I wrote this same review on their facebook page, and management never responded. I have sworn off going here since then, but last night I decided to give it another shot since my fiance wanted to play some games for his birthday. \\n\\nI would give this experience two stars as well. A lot of games were not working, and the games that did work were EXPENSIVE. I get that it\\'s in a tourist-y area, but really? 9 credits for one game where you don\\'t get a substantial amount of tickets? It\\'s not like the prizes you offer are anymore reasonably priced, and the cheap prizes are dollar store things. \\n\\nAlso, management decided it would be advantageous to dust their ceiling off as my fiance and I were standing right next to them. We were playing a game when dust just came pouring down on us - seriously?! You couldn\\'t warn us first? Afterwards, when we walked away, the manager made eye contact with us, saw us covered in dust, and didn\\'t say anything. I was appalled. \\n\\nI have tried to like this place, but I just can\\'t.

Compared to the old GameWorks, the selection is a fraction of what used to be and half the games weren't functioning correctly either. Also the useless bar/restaurant area composes half of this GameWorks. That's right, they put more effort into building an eatery rather than getting decent GAMES. The E-Sports arena was pretty decent and the bowling area looked cool as well.\\n\\nBe prepared to spend at least $20+ if you wish to have a decent experience as the GameWorks cards no longer work by hours.

Because they oversell the amount of people they let in.', 'Brought my 3 children here on a Friday night. It is  loud so be prepared. \\nWe originally bought 2 cards with $20 on them. After 10 minutes I realized they would be out of money real quick SO I inquired on the food and play option ($15 for an hour with one food item or $22 for 2 hrs and one food item) . You have to order select food, pay and then you can get your card. We were not hungry but since they wouldn\\'t just sell me a card for the time, I ordered a pizza to go and brought it out to my car. With the hour/ 2 hour card it is simply good for playing. You do not collect \"tickets\" or points. I wish they would simply offer time ( no points) or per credit ( tickets earned) without having to order food. \\nThe \"prizes\" are ok. I like that you can save the card and continue to save the points.', \"Kids love this place but allot of the games are not working.  Upgraded games/maintenance is desperately needed. Not sure if the old games are them trying to be Retro or cheap.  \\n\\nRestaurant is empty because the food is just okay and service is less than desirable. \\n\\nIt's average but with potential.\", \"First time checking out gameworks new location.  And it was awesome.  Love the set up.  Lots of T.V.s. Sports bar feel with video games.  Whats not to love.  Played almost every game in the place with there unlimited hour game card.  Really fun games.  Lots of choices.  Dark escape 4D is by far the tightest game there.   I could play that for hours.  \\nThe food I thought was average bar food.  Had the buffalo wings.  Nice size wings, perfectly cooked crispy yet juicy inside.  Could of been a little spicier and saucier.  But still really good. Would order again.   Wasn't sure how it would be with all the negative reviews.  But I'll be back for sure.  Cool place to catch a NBA game.  Have a few drinks,  do a little gaming.\", \"Pretty neat place. Arcade, bar, bowling, and even karaoke all in one. Only downside tons of children and teenagers everywhere. My friends and I came here for happy hour I believe 9-midnight and it was pretty decent. Happy hour beers were I believe $3 and appetizers $5-$10. We got the mozzarella sticks , pretzel bites, and nachos. Everything was a shareable size between 2 people. The mozzarella sticks and nachos were pretty standard. I like the pretzel sticks but there wasn't enough cheese and if you let them sit too long they became a little tough. Also they have a 8 lane bowling alley. No one was in there besides us so it was a very private experience. We will be back!!!\", \"Way overpriced. We happened to be walking by and thought we'd take our niece inside to play some games. We bought the card with the credits before we noticed the price of the game. On average the games are 9 credits! 1 credit equals 1 quarter, so the games average $2.25! Never coming back again.\", \"It's okay. The only reason we keep coming back is because of the Groupon deal they offer. It's great if you're bored and want to kill time. The Ticket games are way too expensive though. Even the Groupon deal doesn't get you very far with them. Now for the games you can use the all-day pass on, it's cool. They have a variety, but you can get bored quite quickly. There's always 2-3 broken though. But, my son likes the motorcyle thing, so that's what we use it over and over on. Even with the all day pass, we don't spend more than 2 hours here, ever. Like I said BUT, my son likes to go here, even if he gets bored quickly. But then again, he's 5 years old so, even an empty brown box can entertain him.\", 'We had our company Holiday party here on a Saturday. Gameworks manager Ron Arenas helped us arrange the party! He was super accommodating to our needs and made the process very smooth! Our section was reserved and the food came out at the time we requested. It was very delicious too! I have lived here for some years and this was the first time I have been here.  My kids had a blast running around playing while I socialized with my co-workers. Had a great time! Thank you so much Ron for helping us to have a wonderful experience!!', 'Always having a wonderful time with the kids specially when they offer deals that will invite us back in for more game time.', 'The food was not that great and when we went back from playing a few games are food and drinks were gone even after we said we were not finish and the place is more for adults due the drinking even though i spoke to management my drinks were remade in smaller glass and said they remake are food but i dais so you could just but it in the trash the chicken tasted freezer burned and I told the management that if you do go there dont order the chicken', \"We had our company party here & we had a great time. The food was amazingly delicious: \\n-chicken wings\\n-Caesar and Cobb salads \\n-Sliders \\n-Fries \\n-Pizza (kids favorite) \\nOur host did an excellent job in making sure our party had everything we needed. And Ron (the manager) took great care of us. \\n\\nThe 2 hour game cards are a must to get. Yes u can't play the ticket games but our kids still had a lot of fun with all the many other choices there was. Definitely would have my kids bday party here and gonna plan our company party again next year.\", \"While this is a more convenient location than the original Game Works it does somewhat lack the content and size of the strip location. I can't help but compare any venue of the type to Dave & Busters of which there is no comparison. We came for Birthday party, they did do a good job and our server Mike was outstanding. But $11 for six slices of pizza is a bit much as we had to buy over six pizzas to feed 10 hungry teens. Buy the size of the crowd its nice to see Game Works doing well but they could reduce the dinning area to accommodate more gaming space as it was only half full at best on a Saturday night. Overall we had good time.\", \"Walked in the door and greeted with a sour face.   Clearly someone who didn't want to be working.    Not the cheery kids place welcome I was expecting.   Then when I asked for the extra plan she said she already rung me up and couldn't help me.    I asked for the manager who was very pleasant and professional and fixed the issue within seconds.   \\n\\nIf someone doesn't want to work at a people oriented business, choose a different path but don't make your customers feel like you're doing them a favor.   \\n\\nIf it wasn't for the manager I would give this experience a one star.\", \"A little disappointed with GameWorks. Granted I haven't had any alcohol or food there yet, so they might still be able to earn a star, but.. \\n\\nIt was pretty big for where it was located. There is a bar, restaurant, bowling lanes, a computer game room, and a tiny, tiny counter in front of the prize area. Not to mention a pretty large area of general games. \\n\\nOpening was fun. They had a little deal going on for $12 that was pretty sweet. \\nNow, I know that a lot of little kiddies come to TS to play and such, but the kind of games that were there...it was a little disappointing. I expected way better games and a better variety. Of course, some games were closed because they weren't giving out prizes or tickets at opening, but that was to be expected given the foot traffic they got. Though, I thought they would at least have a small raffle or something~! \\n\\nSome of the best things that were there were the shooting games, racing games, the virtual reality roller coaster pod, and the 4D Haunted House game!\", \"Took my 6 year old here for some kid fun. It was was better than the gameworks that use to be on the strip near the mgm. This one is cleaner, it seems bigger or maybe its just their set up is better but its really nice. They have a video game room with up to date video gsme consoles and computers. Very cool cause its like a kids lounge area where they can chill and play video games on couches and or sit at a computer at a desk and chair and play games on there. Also they have a small bowling alley. It was small but for the price it was pretty neat. Only a few dollars per game and shoes. All the games were fun. My daughter really enjoyed the ski ball the most. Some of the games that were more credits than the others was a little bit of s rip off and the way they kept track of your tickets made me wonder because its all on a card and my daughter played for a good hour and only ened up with a small amount of tickets so made me wonder how they track how many ticketd you get per game. But the fact my daughter was having fun made me not even car. She got about 500 tickets for the entired 3 hrs we were there. She got to get 3 small toys at the prize area. The lady said she was 20 tickets over with the one prize she picked out but she just let my dsughter have the small little cup she wanted. So that was very nice customer service.  I mean you figured if im spending $30-$50 for my 6 yr old to play games there the fact they let her walk with one small free gift shouldnt be a big deal since i spent more money on the games than the toys. Lol. The toy is worth less. I guess you're just pretty much paying foe the experience not the toys. Thats a better way of saying it. I will for sure go bsck again sometime.  She liked it and I like that she liked it. I like that its right there in town square too. What a nice location. Convenient and also smart because they probably get a lot of teenagers and or kids cause its right near the movie theater and town square is pretty busy most of the time.\", \"If you're looking for a deal at this place, there is a catch.  They don't tell you on the sight or at the facility until you ask. I am not for spending a lot of money and my kids don't get to play all the games or even win tickets.  This place is a complete rip off.\", \"Recently was shopping in Town Square on a Sunday and thought I would stop by and have a drink with my girlfriend. And out of all the places to stop by, I chose the wrong place.\\n\\nService was EXTREMELY slow. Took the bartender 10 to notice we been sitting at the bar. On top of that, after we placed our order he FORGOT to get it! It's not like they were busy, let's be real.\\n\\nWe thought we would bring you business, however I see you didn't want it. The operations seem to act just like the children running around the place. \\n\\nIf stopping by Town Square, I recommend going anywhere else for a cocktail/beer BUT here.\", \"First time we went there, got a drink at the bar and bartender charged more for drinks with no receipt and didn't think we would notice. Gave it one more chance and tried the meal and play for 14.99. The waitress was terrible, the sandwich was toasted and was so hard it cut up my mouth. Waitress gave us someone else's check. All over terrible service!!!!!!!\", 'My kids LOVED this place! So this review is for them.\\nMe on the other hand am not into video gaming so thank god this place was attached to a mall.\\nWe went on a Tuesday w our Vegas POGO passes. A POGO pass is a pass we purchased online before we hit up Vegas. It includes a bunch of kid activities for a small fee of $40 per person. This place was on the list so we came and my kids stayed for hours AND hours. Since game works was so quiet my kids stayed in the gaming room for well passed the one hour allotment. He loved it! All the staff there were friendly and very helpful.', 'Who said GAMEWORKS at Town Square is only for birthdays!!!! Our family is COSMIC BOWLING, playing in the video arcade and having our family Christmas gift exchange.! The manager RON made our family feel warm & welcomed and made sure he introduced us to our server (Brittany-also super duper nice) for any drinks or food orders. Everything is cozy & close enough to keep an eye on the squirrels and still have fun. We are so happy we decided to celebrate the holiday here instead of the crazy casinos! MERRY Xmas!', 'Had a great time at Gameworks at Town Square last night. Jarred was our server while we were bowling. Jarred was very knowledgeable about the food menu and was spot on about the Short Ribs entree (2 big pieces of beef short ribs over a bed of creamy mashed potatoes and gravy). Wish they had more games tho. I spent about 2 hours on the new Transformers game and the jet fighter game.', \"I would originally give them 3 stars but after taking advantage of their new deal they offer on Thursdays, I would definitely say 4 stars! This deal I'm talking about is $10 for UNLIMITED game playing from 5pm-Close on Thursdays! Awesome! I feel like they read everyone's mind because it would always be kind of pricey to play before, I feel like $20 goes so fast here and I bet that's true for a lot of parents as well. So Thursdays is the way to go! The only catch is that the games that offer tickets, well you can still play them but they don't give you tickets. Makes sense, $10 is such a steal and then you get free prizes too? No way haha That's no problem for me since I don't really care about the prizes but that definitely could be an issue for the little ones. \\nMy favorites are the football throwing game, skeeball, air hockey, mario kart and this other game that you knock down clowns with balls in an alotted amount of time. Also out of all of the games offered I think there were only 2 out of order so that's not too bad. As for the unlimited game play, you can't use your card at the photobooth but I didn't have a problem using it with anything else. Overall, I probably would only come here Thursdays now, I'll definitely be back!\", \"This is long overdue, but I can't tell you how pleased I was with the service inside the esports area. It was our first time and how eager we are to go back! You have the option of $5/hr or $20 for 5 hours and you don't have to use it all at once. Save your credit for a rainy day. The young men working there are extremely fun, knowledgeable and attentive! We also ordered food and drinks.  We couldn't get enough of the amazing Mac n Chz Balls!!! And the attendants were so kind in refilling our sodas. I couldn't ask for more. My son said it was the best day ever! Thanks guys for an outstanding job!!! :)\", \"Video games and attractive bartenders, it's almost the equation for a perfect wet dream. They don't just have the run of the mill games either. The fact that MarioKart is up in there is worth 4 stars alone. Oh and if you get a shot of Patron here, which you better because this is Vegas, expect a gigantic shot because these ladies aren't selfish with their liquor. The only down side is that there are a couple kids in there and my adult ass would like to be in the company of other adults even though I'm socially awkward and won't talk to them anyway. Definitely a good spot to go to with the girlfriend or boyfriend (No judgements) just don't be in there drunk playing video games solo...it's slightly depressing lol! But hey...at least you're out of the house.\", 'Recently took our son here for a celebration, we came on a weekday so it would be less crowded and we could enjoy the games. After purchasing put game card we discovered 50% or more of the games were broken and most of the others we tried to play either were malfunctioning or would freeze while we were playing. Along with that there was no one to greet us as we walked in. Apparently they were not serving food that day either which we learned by a taped piece of paper on the wall. \\nThe carpets are filthy and the smell inside is quite unpleasant. \\nWe came here when they first opened and it was great, but has gone down hill fast.', \"We were very disappointed . The restaurant looks like it just a temporary spot. They failed to do much with spot other than paint walls place chairs and tables.. A few TVA and  games..  Not much more to see. \\nThe food was terrible and considering there was only one other family there you would think they could do a better job. My caesars salad was soaked with dressing and soggy. The chicken was okay. My husbands fish and chips were dripping with old oil.. But the kids seemed to like the chicken strips and French fries. I think the only thing that was okay to me was the calamari and aioli dip. \\nThe rides/ games were extremely over priced. However  at least the service was excellent. Laura our waitress was great and made sure we never had to ask for a refill. She was the one bright spot. \\nWe don't have plans to go back.. Rather wait til we travel to a place that has a Dave and busters.\", 'This is one of the cleanest and nicest GameWorks we have ever visited. They have a bowling alley, a bar that serves food, pool tables, and of course a plethora of fun games. There is also a cool Gaming room where you can play online PC games, XBox and Nintendo games. Staff is nice too! We stop by here every time we are shopping at Town Square. :)', 'Amazing place. I can leave my son here for hours. Last several times here, I scored the Groupon deal for $20, all day pass. That is a bargain. Love the fact that you can even play basketball toss and skee ball with the pass. We went for three hours, went to a basketball tournament, grabbed dinner, then came back for another two hours. Awesome place, awesome deal.', \"Don't waste your time or money on this place, it is a joke and the management should be embarrassed that they're allowing people in the door. NOTHING like any other Gameworks you've ever been to...\\n\\nWe should have known we were in for a disaster when the poorly designed dining room (dumpy leather couch  from someone's dorm room in the way too-big waiting area?) only had one table of people at 8:30pm on a Friday night. But we had been looking forward to checking the place out for so long we let them seat us anyhow and tried to make the best of it by straining our necks to watch the too-small, misplaced TV's and ordering some food off of the very few options on their 1-page, Kinko's printed menu with too-small font. \\n\\nWhile waiting for our food, we watched the wait staff deliver a plate of nachos to an empty table by the front door/windows (where hundreds of people walked by, looked in at the boring scene, and kept on moving). The employees proceeded to grab a few nachos here and there every time they passed by, and a few even sat down to eat. I thought maybe they were off the clock until one of them left the nachos, went in the back, and came back out with our food delivery. \\n\\nThe food was just so-so and not at all worth the price. I asked the server for some salt for my french fries and she dropped off an actual cup with salt in it and then started to walk off (as if this was the norm). I asked if there were any salt shakers, she said no, and then walked back to her own table of food. \\n\\n I wish I could rate the game area but it's completely blocked off from the bar and restaurant (WHY??) and the dining experience was such a disappointing and boring downer that we decided to leave and head across to Yard House and Blue Martini to finish our date night instead.  \\n\\n We will never be going back here and my prediction is that it will be closed within a year unless some SERIOUS changes are made.\", \"Went for the gaming experience and it was okay. It's a lot smaller than the location on the strip. I do like how they've incorporated a card to swipe your credits now instead of actual tokens. But, it could use some improvements.\", 'I have been to a large amount of lan centers/gaming cafes, but non like this. There was a lot of the same stuff in which you would see at other places, but the service itself really outshined any other place that I have been too. Dante made the experience something special with his knowledge of games and ability to assist with any questions my friend and I had. Truly an amazing experience.', 'Thank you Shana for your awesome service and for helping me with the surprise cake for my daughter thank you. ..', \"Kareem is why I keep coming back. Hello,'I love you. Most fun and the best drinks I have had ever, ever! See you in a month for my sister's bachelorette party!!\", 'Had fun when I came to visit from Los Angeles. However too many kids and most machines were out of order near the bar area.', \"This place has a LONG way to go before it's worth the money, so I will spare them the one star review....for now. This location is about 1/3 the size of their others.  The Seattle location puts this place to shame.  We got two hours of free play, but half the games were not working.   I paid $54 for 400 credits for future use.  The menu looks appetizing, but way too expensive.  I got one draft beer and it was $7!  The best part of this location?  It is right across the sidewalk from Yard House.  We will likely use GameWorks as entertainment for our kids while my wife and I hit happy hour at Yard House.  Unless they come up with a happy hour with major discounts, I will never buy food or drink here.  Without drastic improvements this location will become the hangout for kids waiting for their movie at AMC, and that will mean once my 400 credits run out, my card will be permanently filed in the circular canister.\", \"I have never been to a GameWorks, so I'm not sure what I was expecting. \\n\\nIt is unlike other gaming lounges in that they don't integrate the gaming, food and bar areas very well. They have a defined bar and restaurant area that is pretty much empty every time I've ever passed through and then there is a small gaming floor with a mixture of ticketed gaming machines for kids and other video game machines. \\n\\nI think if they had spread this area out a bit more there would be more room to move around and enjoy the games. It was overly crowded and there weren't too many games that looked worth the time and money to play. The only ones that did were packed and had long waits.\\n\\nThere are so many improvements that could be made here to make it better.\", \"9pm.Tues nite..

What is with these companies closing their locations down and making locals wait years for a new establishment that has less to offer than their previous location?

So we were sitting in the esports couch area and we were told to leave the area. I was a little annoyed but understandable. i asked the assistant manager to find a place for her to sit. he was an excellent manager. i forgot their names but the assistant helped us. hes a middle eastern/asian looking. skinny good looking guy. he took us to an vacant room for us and it was really nice. then the main manager who looks like a typical redneck trash who told us to leave because we brought food from home. we understood but we were willing to spend money to cater her very need. but she would not let us. so we had to walk across the store again back to the car. We were here before and they just lost their regular customers. Fire the main manager and promote the assistant. \\n\\np.s. they made a 95 year old woman walk all over the store. if something happened.... i know you dont care about her but think about your job. if something happened to her..... your going to get sued. and were from los angeles. we sue.', \"This Gameworks is awesome there's great games food bowling pool and even esports where you can play PC games and console games and a pretty good selection of prizes you can buy with points or what they call tickets and all the employees iv meet have been super nice and helpful for the most part.\\n\\nI'm glad that Las Vegas is putting money back into places for kids and teens to enjoy and not just for adults. \\n\\nIt's at a really easy location to get to and away from the busy hassle of the strip.\\n\\nThe old Gameworks on the strip was a great place but let's get real it was dying and had to be updated.

Lots of games, including a room full of computers, with XBox and Playstation set-ups. The rollercoaster simulator was really fun. The restaurant and bar had friendly staff members. Typical bar food, but it was ok. You can walk around the whole place with your beer or cocktail. I don't think they need such a large dining area.\", 'So always been fan of the concept of GameWorks since I visited one in Seattle years ago. The whole different arcade games some throwbacks, current games, and interactive games with the EA sport area not mention the indoor bowling alley. Not forget about the little ones for games earn tickets then redeem them later. The whole bar/restaurant area that something like but not fan at the same time. It nice that they offer good diversity of food not your basic bar menu grub all deep fried or off the grill. I like the location of this GameWorks in Town Square Mall on the strip. I like the fact they serve beers by the pitchers as option!  I like fact that tons of televisions all over the place in the bar and restaurant area for sports. Not fan the bar area. It hardly feels like bar area that can lounge around and relax with friends. Your right smack next to the entrance so see people coming and going or kids running around. It could be good thing free entertainment. LOL. The service was awful. I went up two separate occasions the first time. Not sure if he was bartender or bar back. The guy cleaning glasses working not once did he acknowledge me. I literally was standing in front of his face the whole time. Hi. Someone will be with you. The other two bartenders just whatever I had get there attention just get drink. The bar had no personality feel like counter top in middle of open space. The restaurant area itself not much better with personality feels like more cafeteria setting I feel just open space with tables and couple booths outside. Service at times was not on it. To be fair came to GameWorks after friends wedding reception for night cap get together. Everyone showed at random times. They did do fabulous job with no reservations rearrange tables (we helped moved them or they did) ended up with over 30 peeps spread out over three or four tables. Well done. \\n\\nI had some of my friends food. I tried the pretzel bites. They were ok. The cheese sauce tasted out of can. The nachos that was solid. It was loaded with pretty much everything. Really all the food saw coming out to the table looked good. \\n\\nIf playing tourist GameWorks is place that might stop by again. If want throw back days in 808 going Tilt or Fun Factory (local peeps would appreciate the shout out) would go GameWorks. The food and drinks honest so many other great spots in Town Square would skip that part at GameWorks.', 'Last night we celebrated my husband\\'s nephew\\'s birthday here, per his request. The establishment is located in Town Square on the ground floor, right under the AMC Theater. There is ample parking in Town Square and the meters are used to collect donations, not to enforce parking fees, in short - your car won\\'t get towed if you don\\'t have change to spare. \\n\\nWe arrived on a Thursday night at 615 pm. The dining area was practically empty apart from our party, party of 21. We occupied about five tables, but only three tables were ready to order when the wait-service came around. I was a little confused because we saw several servers and yet only one came by to take our orders. After he was done taking orders at one table, he went back to put the orders in, and took a while doing it too, and then came back for the next table. This went on until it was our turn to order, mind you we were the last table. \\n\\nI didn\\'t mind that he was taking a while to get our orders but, we didn\\'t get our water/beverages till after. I saw that he was rushing around and walking with a purpose (the dining area is kind of big). What killed me in the end was waiting for our food to come out and finally getting our check and game cards. \\n\\nI ordered the Cobb Salad which is a 1-hour Game Card item, the Classic Quesadilla with chicken for my kids to share- thats another 1-hour Game Card item, my husband had the Seared Salmon, and we had wings to share-buffalo style. Overall, the food was good. I probably wouldn\\'t come back just to eat the food, as nothing really stood out. We were here to play games after all. \\n\\nBTW the special from Mon-Fri is that they give you 1-hour game cards when you order the game card specific items from their menu. That was a no brainer for me since my kids have too many toys at home and I didn\\'t want them bringing more \"prizes\" home. It was about 830 pm by the time we finally checked out and received our game cards. I Checked-In on Yelp and registered/signed up for the Game Works program, so I received a coupon for a free $10 game card + 25 Bonus Points, a manager had to come around and verify my phone number in order to redeem the coupon since I didn\\'t print it out. So of course, that took some time as well. \\n\\n1-hour of gaming is a lot of time when you are with a 6 yr old and 3 yr old. I would recommend this Mon-Friday happy hour deal to anyone who doesn\\'t mind not being able to win tickets. Not all games are ticket. \\n\\nI did a quick restroom trip, it seemed clean enough-there is also a gender neutral restroom for families. I spied a bowling alley, a couple pool tables, a private party room, and a bar. Cool place to bring the entire family.', \"First off- weird configuration with choppy separation of games and dining.  I like Dave & Busters where it's all more incorporated so parents can sit and still be in same room with kids while they play and we can enjoy food and cocktails.  So instead, I followed the kids around, lugging all the winter coats and hats.\\n\\nAfter blowing $80 myself and another $100 with friends, we finally went to eat and ordered a bunch of pizzas.  They tasted more like frozen tombstone pizzas but bigger than I though based on yelp reviews.  The problem was service.  Other than taking the initial order and dropping food, we NEVER saw our waitress.  I had to literally walk around the dining room on three occasions flagging down OTHER waitresses for extra plates, drink refills, etc.  the dining area was NOT full.  Each server had maybe a maximum of 3 tables to serve.  \\n\\n3 hours after being served and then after 20 minutes trying to hunt down our bill, I finally was fed up.  I saw three managers in a corner and approached them and told them what happened and asked for the bill.  Meanwhile, others in my party asked another waitress for my bill, who then found our waitress, who dropped it off.  We sat there, with credit card in the bill sleeve and again, waited and no one came to pick it up.  So I walked the bill and credit card to the manager myself.  The manager (Heather maybe) was on it.  She apologized profusely and said she understaffed the dining room.  I've waitressed before and if a server can't handle 3 tables, they need better servers. Without us asking, the manager comped the ENTIRE meal and gave us free 1 hour play cards.  \\n\\nWhile the experience was frustrating- I would go back simply because management responded so well.  I felt bad too, thinking of leaving a tip for the server- not huge but something.  But I saw her talking to the manager and looking at our table and throwing her arms in the air in disgust and then storming off.  That just really turned me off.  She never apologized for any delay.  Not sure if right or not, and might get a lot of flak but I really don't reward bad servers.  We were a table full of hungry people and we sat with empty plates, etc. for. a long time.  That server really missed the opportunity to sell us a salad, some wings and dessert.  But she never checked in on us.\\n\\nWe will return and try the restaurant again simply to support the business and hope they fix their kinks.  And if we get decent service, we will tip appropriately.  But I hope they work this out- it could've been a great locals addition to Town Square.\", \"Oh man, what a great place. That one handsome tall buff guy, i think his name's Jake, helped us out so much. AJ was a lot of help too. All very friendly. Such a great environment.\", \"Worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. Waited 30 minutes after finishing the meal and never got the check. Server did not come back to refill drinks . Did not bring requested items several times . Still had to wait and the entire party got up and walked to the front of the restaurant because the manager never came out to the table. Would never eat here again or recommend it to anybody. Food was also substandard, tasted only mildly better than gas station prepared food and was far more expensive. After everything was said and done the only concession given was a 20% reduction on the check as well as a card for games in the arcade which didn't work in half the machines because the readers on the arcade games were faulty, it would take several tries to get the card to read on many of the machines if we could get it to read at all.\", \"Awesome  place! We came for a buddies birthday party. Great location to shop, watch movies, and family time! Jarred from Mississippi was an awesome server. He made some great recommendations and kept our drinks and stomachs full. Overall a great experience.

I've gone there twice and both times I've got ripped off from the machines. I played the bejewelled game and have won more than 1000 tickets (2x Tuesday) when I went to redeem them the machine did not upload them to my card... Had to argue with the manager and tell him the machine was not working properly which I'm sure they are aware of but pretend like they don't know. He finally gave me the tickets afterwards. I will not be purchasing a red card ever again... Complete waist of money and a complete rip off.

The party room, host and food was excellent. The birthday party included an hour of free game play for the kids. The party room had TV's on with sports as well as music. Our experience was excellent!\", \"Arcade fun that ranks up there with the best Vegas has to offer, with the price tag to match. I could easily end the review here and feel like I covered the very basic gist of what this place is all about, but allow me to get a bit more in-depth-- starting with a very short background story. \\n\\nGameWorks is no stranger to Sin City, having held open a Strip-side location that saw early success, but ultimately couldn't make ends meet. After a substantial hiatus, they once again returned, this time making their home in Town Square. \\n\\nAfter enjoying this location since its opening, I can safely say this was mutually a good decision on their part-- for myself and their business. Traffic rarely wanes during the summer, even on weekdays. The location itself is more suited for locals since parking is easier to come by than the Strip location, and traffic is far less of an issue. The single-level design of the arcade might be a point of contention for quite a few who knew the old GameWorks, but I find it a lot easier to navigate.\\n\\nThe games themselves are decently maintained, not to the scope that certain Round 1s I've been to are, but enough that on any given day that few machines, if any, will ever be out of service during operating hours.\\n\\nThe staff are generally attentive to most needs in my experience, but things of that nature are VERY different between person to person and your mileage will vary.\\n\\nPrices for menu and bar items are about what you'd expect. The menu has improved quite a bit over time, but the options wouldn't be enough to entice the truly picky from other offerings within walking distance. It's bar food for casual bites, not a Zagat-rated establishment.\\n\\nThe hidden jewel of this place, however, is not the bowling alley, restaurant area, Dark Ride or the redemption counter-- it lies within the E-Sports center. Rows of consoles and gaming PCs await to satisfy the needs of more at-home gamers, with frequent community events for certain games to give the place a sense of being a hub for all that's happening in the world of competitive gaming. Of all the areas in this arcade, this one has always felt the most welcoming too.\\n\\nAll that, and you can order food and alcohol in the E-Sports area (provided you are of legal age).\\nImagine all of the drunk Mario Kart games you could have with your friends...\\n\\nAll in all, GameWorks has become a bit of a cornerstone in the gaming scene here, and it's not going anywhere. With its central location, great entertainment options and cozy E-Sports center, it's well-suited for players of all levels, casual and competitive.\", \"Used the Groupon's for family members was the best choice to kill a day we didn't have much planned. It was worth it. Friendly staff and food was surprisingly good. Little on the higher priced side of food and drinks, but it was convenient. Good games options all around. Total spent was $150 for all day play. $20 each Groupon x 5 = $100 and $50 bucks on two appetizers and drinks.\", \"Oh Gameworks! I have been here a couple of times but I finally got to try the food and drinks. The food wasn't bad at all. We had a sliders trio and loaded fries! Our alcoholic drinks (blueberry martini and Moscow mule) were terrible and tasted like rubbing alcohol. The prices for the food was reasonable.\\n\\nOn to the games:\\nThey have this crazy LAN center that takes up way too much space. This place is always crowded and none of the games are available and when they are they are sooooooo fun!\\n\\nOverall, this is a cute date night place and stray away from the drinks unless it's a beer :)\", 'Okay before i start this let me say that I AM glad that gameworks is back.  After nearly 3 years i really really....REALLY missed having it around.\\n\\nNow let me begin...\\n\\nFirst off, this place was a bigger letdown than i could\\'ve ever imagined. There couldn\\'t possibly be any more than 45 arcade games on the game floor. The space that could be used to fit more game machines is currently taken up by over-optimistic restaurant space, unused party/banquet rooms and fancy looking walls. As it is at any gameworks a nice percentage of games were broken....but the difference between this gameworks and the others is that there\\'s not much else to choose from....remember there\\'s not even 50 machines on the floor which leads to my next complaint....a 2-3 person line to play literally any game on the floor. I\\'m not one to complain about waiting his turn, but this is a first for me at a gameworks. Arcade favorites like sonic the fighters, afterburner climax, marvel vs. Capcom, mortal kombat, street fighter, need for speed, f1 Ferrari challenge, and many many others are all MISSING from the roster. They used to be at the gameworks on the strip....i just don\\'t understand why they wouldn\\'t be here. The ticket/prize games are usually separated at most gameworks locations. Since this one is soooo tiny, they all just blend together. The prize redemption area is soooo small. I was tripping over small children and a couple of large, buff, angry dudes. Very uncomfortable...i never even got to choose my prize. More tickets for next time i suppose... Oh, and gamer beware. Many games will deduct points and the game will never acknowledge that you payed. Luckily the managers were able to see the cards swipe history and refund the card. in comparison to any other gameworks in the country....This game floor gets an F. \\n\\nThe e-sports room is passable....literally...you can pass right by it and not even notice it\\'s there. Its a decent price to rent an xbox and tv but honestly the game roster is small. I\\'m not sure if you can bring your own or not. Theres a total of 4 stations with televisions. Imho they should have at least 7 or 8 but that\\'s just my two cents. They have a 60pc lan party...which is 40 less than what was advertised last year. Which reminds me...they told us on the gameworks facebook and website that there would be a laser tag arena.....which...there is none. Very disappointing. The e-sports will definitely bring in revenue. It just needs more games and console/tv stations. The e-sport section gets a C.\\n\\nThe bowling ally and pool table area is nice. And it has its own bar which is cool since you don\\'t have to leave to goto the game floor for a drink. You rent your shoes at the door. The alley lanes are very narrow compare to say...the station casinos. They\\'re basically miniature bowling lanes....i haven\\'t played on the lanes yet so its not really fair for me to review it. Id say a B just because it exists.\\n\\nLastly, the overall service and restaurant. I didn\\'t eat at the restaurant yet...and i don\\'t believe i ever will. Allow me to explain. I asked the bartender at the bowling center for a glass of water. He immediately tells me itll be \"a while\" before he can serve me the water. Which is fine....note that he had a group of 3 people to serve before me and as soon as he was done serving them...\"a while\" never came for me. No biggie. I guess good service is reserved for paying bar patrons. After spending 100 on points (which is ridiculous. I\\'ve never spent more than 40 bucks at any gameworks and i usually get hours of entertainment!) you\\'d think you would be treated half as decently as a hole in the wall bar. Later on i noticed i was hungry and i wanted something light, so i grabbed some wetzels pretzels which isn\\'t far from gameworks.....BIG MISTAKE. I was just about halfway through my pretzel and walking back into gameworks when i was met with the most absurd statement: \"we don\\'t allow outside food. Sorry.\" excuse me? I just spent how much money.....to play broken games?! I\\'m sure you wont mind if i finish my pretzel while i walk through your precious, oversized restaurant past your pitiful, undersized gamefloor, and get in my car. Service gets a D. \\n\\nWorst gameworks experience I\\'ve ever had. I have been going to various gameworks locations since i was 9 years old. I\\'m 26 now. I\\'ve never seen anything like this. It\\'s as if they only care about making money. I wish sega never sold gameworks to espn. I hope this helps them make better decisions in the future and fall back to their former glory! Long live gameworks!\\n\\n  i give them six months to add more games before i write them off my hangout spots list.', '1lady there that works at the bar needs a attitude adjustment also she do not know how to make the drinks proper and very mean rude should be fired', 'Oh man, I\\'m torn on this place. \\n\\nI used to go to the GameWorks on the Strip when I was kid. I mean, I even remember going to the original grand opening and losing mind because it was so amazing, two stories of video games! That\\'s a lot for a 14-year-old boy to handle. Now this new GameWorks location is in Town Square and it\\'s not like the one of yesteryear, but more of a sports bar fused with a Chuck E. Cheese. \\n\\nThey added a few new things like a full bowling alley, which looks amazing, a huge bar for the alcoholic pinball lovers, and a few hundred TVs. I like the lay out here also; there are two main entrances on each side of the building, which is super convenient, and the length of the bar is great because I don\\'t like feeling like I\\'m sitting on the guy next to me. The have an okay mix of games, but I feel like they need to incorporate more of the classics. They have \"Donkey Kong\" and \"Centipede\", plus a few others, but this isn\\'t enough of the old school favorites. I hate to say it, but my age and demo will be the main customers frequenting this place and if you don\\'t up the nostalgia factor here you might be setting yourself up for the ultimate, GAME OVER. The other side of this is most \"little\" kids or hardcore gamers would rather stay in their room and play \"Call of Duty\" with some other kid from Germany. They don\\'t want to be bothered with socializing or paying for something they already have at home. I\\'m voting for Super Mario 3!\\n\\nOnce I was done playing Skee-Ball and destroying some T-1000s on the Terminator shooter game I needed something in my belly. I still had stuff to do that day so I ordered a Cesar salad and some fries, you know...keeping it lite. These were good by \"Barcade\" standards. The salad was big and fresh and the french fries came with this cocktail sauce infused ketchup, pretty tasty! Of course I had to order a cocktail before I left, \"One Moscow Mule please\". (keeping it lite) This was actually the shining light of my visit. Sweet, tangy, and refreshing with just enough vodka and ginger. \\n\\nAll in all, it was an OK experience and I feel like they are still working out some of the kinks, hence the three star rating. It\\'s definitely not the GameWorks that was stuck in my memory, but I will be back to give it a second chance. Plus, who else will dominate all the little kids on the Pac-Man Air Hockey game.', 'Albeit a smaller venue, not too bad - kids enjoyed themselves! From my POV:\\n\\n1. Space too small\\n2.

Some food items can get pricey.\\n\\nThe eSports room was the area most enjoyed by my family.\\n\\nOverall, there are other places to spend time with family and friends...I don\\'t know how often we will be back.', 'This Gameworks location is great and is far better than almost any other arcade style restaurant venue anywhere near the vicinity of the Las Vegas area.  Of the comments by others that criticise this Gameworks, it is often that this location lacks some of the greatness of other or past Gameworks locations.  While some of that I agree with, the comparison should be Gameworks now compared to their competitors now, not Gameworks compared to themselves of the past.\\n\\nThe dining areas, bar areas, bowling areas, arcade areas, and the console gaming areas all look great.  The arcade prices generally are about four credits per game, which is one dollar with no promotions or bulk purchase of credits whatsoever.  Most generic arcades in the major hotels would have similar pricing, yet Gameworks provides a much nicer, friendlier and healthier enviroment than going inside a Las Vegas hotel/casino.  In addition, they have deals, 190 credits for $27, making that one-dollar game just 57 cents.  The pricing is good; I do not see where some of these complaints come from.  It is a far better value than Dave and Busters located throughout the country.\\n\\nThe Las Vegas design is different than many other Gameworks, but that is fine.  I personally do not understand the space given to console internet computer gaming, but that may appeal to others.  If that does not work out as expected, a great idea would be to expand the arcade space, which is what many arcade enthusiasts want to happen.  Maybe put in a clever time tunnel entrance and have some great, nearly forgotten games from the 80s and 90s in there that nearly no one has anymore (possibly locate a game list from when the first Gameworks opened, and replicate some of it).  If management wants an idea of games, I would be glad to submit some ideas, or go on killer list of videogames dot com for a blast from the past reminder of games that once existed.  Possibly, add a few more classic cabinets to overflow and transition between sections, so the place is not quite so compartmentalized.  All of this is not a complaint, just ideas to make this new Gameworks even better and enhance it with some classic nestalgia from Gameworks past.\\n\\nIn closing, Gameworks Las Vegas does not deserve an average rating less than four stars.  Those who live in the area should enjoy what it has to offer instead of comparing it to absolute arcade perfection.  Again, compare it to what little else is present in Las Vegas family fun, enjoy the games and the environment of fun that exists inside all Gameworks locations.  I do want to also mention that in my opinion many other Gameworks, current and past, deteriorated over time.  Please do not allow entropy to set in here, please keep the games well maintained and focus on customer service and Gameworks will do well.', \"Where to start... \\n\\nI ordered a sandwich from their very limited lunch menu and when my food arrived it was not what I ordered and instead of fixing the situation, our server argued with me about how I ordered my sandwich.

The assortment of games is very small and the ones that most patrons want to play are broken. \\n\\nBeware of unruly, unsupervised children!

Apparently we missed a few big ticket games, and since we still had 15 minutes, we went back and totally scored!! Jonathan got down to my 5 year olds level and told him what the coolest prizes were and boosted his confidence by congratulating him on ALL the tickets he won. :) He even talked him into sharing something with his little sister, so everyone went home happy. My son can't wait to go back because he thinks Jonathan is his best friend now. Thanks Gameworks! You have our business for life!\", \"Basically you pay money and you can play the games here's. The place is called GameWorks, you play games here. Half the reviews of the people giving 1 star reviews don't seem to realize that you don't get an unlimited playtime.\", \"Gameworks seems too crowded. Every machine was Taken, so you practically have to fall in line for every game. We went on a Saturday afternoon/evening time. During the week it's probably much less busy so at least one game could be playable without having to wait. Had a done in and the service was quick and delicious. No problems with that.\\nAnd I felt that there were too many racing games. Not enough 4 player games or FPS. Nice location, great atmosphere.\", \"Cons. Kinda pricey , limited floor space for the games. The restaurant area looks incredibly mundane and bland. I honestly think whoever designed this place was having a indentity crisis .

Well ventilated for all the people inside. \\n\\n\\nOverall it needs work, needs more floor games, still something to take the kids to do in this town you cant beat that . If it gets better I'll def come back\", \"Yeah...\\n\\nSo Like everyone else, I am very disappointed with this location. I was so excited for it also! I thought that it would be a great addition to the Town Square and was really hoping it could live up to the previous version of Gameworks that was on the Strip.. at least a little. In my opinion however, it does not. Not even close. Which, is understandable actually. The Las Vegas Strip Location was fantastic in many ways. If  the Town Square location could even be 1/4 of what the previous version was, it could be great. \\n\\nI agree that first and foremost, this place should be about the games. I also believe that they have really failed at the design of the space as far as the games go. There appear to be a lot of cool games though they are crammed into a corner. The layout is not cool. So clustered and uncomfortable to walk through when there are many players around. \\n\\nStaff was all awesome and very accommodating, I will say  that now.\\n\\nI walked around a bit and saw the space in the back, that appears to be for private events maybe? A few empty rooms with LCD TV's mounted on the walls. I don't know, but I'd rather see that filled with games and maybe some themed rooms. That's another thing.. the space is so stark and boring and as I mentioned previously, the layout is kinda whack. \\n\\nThe bar specifically, and even a restaurant that serves alcohol should not be something that kids walk through. It's not a difficult fix. There should be a divider wall between those areas. there are a couple of spaces that can be divided off for over and under 21 patrons. I understand that Gameworks will draw many under 21 people, but  as this is Las  Vegas and there is a huge market for the adult kids! As it stands, it's very uncomfortable to sit at the bar. Your back is to the walkway with kids going by, just not cool in my opinion. It even looks uncomfortable for the bartenders and servers to be serving there. \\n\\nI know that people reading this: employees, managers, owners and guests alike, will agree, disagree and be every range of emotion available at these reviews that are so negative. It's not easy opening a new place. Going in, everyone knew there were high expectations. \\n\\nI can't even go into much else without writing a full website on the subject, but I feel like this Gameworks needs a serious overhaul already. I really look forward to some major changes and hope that they come sooner than later. I will occasionally drop in to help support that.. but I cannot see myself spending money on games until those credits drop or you some form of unlimited play is offered as it has been in the past.. say $20 10pm-until close for adults, and something for the kids on weekends? \\n\\nI wish you luck Gameworks! You are responsible for a great many happy and fun memories in my earlier years! I want to be part of something great like that again!\", \"I took my family to Gameworks in Las Vegas in July 2016, and we had a good time.\\n\\nWe got a great deal with a Groupon for all day game play.

We almost didn't eat here.\\n\\nThe restaurant was loud because of the arcade, there were lots of television playing sports.\\n\\nThe waitstaff was friendly.

Our party host Brittney was attentive to my guest, because a bunch of boys will undoubtedly spill a drink or two, and the food and drinks never ran dry.

The place wasn't even as crowded as you would expect, I think because the word is out on the place already, and i got there at 8:50pm to eat, way past the dinner rush and the popular 6-7:30 dinner rush. One and a half hour meal and drinks could have been finished in about half that time, just spent too much time waiting. Me and Gary Z preordered our next drink because the first drink took half an hour to get the first one, lol. At least 35 min to even take our order for food.

After we ordered, we watch the bartender as he scrambled to figure out where everything was. Our drinks were simple, not fancy at all, one vodka soda and a whiskey coke. After looking for a couple of minutes, he comes back and tells me that they're out of the vodka I wanted, so I quickly picked another. He took about 4 minutes to make each drink. After sitting for 30 minutes at a half empty bar, we finally got our drinks.

Amazing atmosphere all around and surprisingly enough, not as loud as I expected to be (but then again it was a semi late Sunday night.) The food provided was excellent--we had a range from Pizza, wings, mini pretzels, tortilla chips, jalepeno poppers and mini sliders (which I kept coming back for, haha.) Our hosts were amazing! I forgot their names sadly (I swear one was named Lorenzo?) but the female hostess with the purple hair was extremely sweet and helpful and our male server was funny and cool as well! GW provided us free game cards and a 2 hour play card but this is a place where you get tired out at easily depending on what game you play (or what you're doing overall), so I only did a couple rounds of DDR. Noting from other reviewers, the games mostly seemed to be back in working condition, so I suppose they recently fixed everything? The only disappointment was the E-sports looked lacking (again, the time and day could have contributed to that.) Would I be back? Probably not because it is QUITE a distance from my place of residence but for special occasions, absolutely. Definitely a place to check out if you're needing an arcade fix or just a cool place to hang.\", 'Recently discovered that my 11YO enjoys playing pool, briefly considered getting him a fake ID so we can hit up PTs. Or tossing all furniture out of the living room and getting a pool table. Still working on the first option for Mr Papagiorgio, in the mean time we made Gameworks our go to spot for playing pool. \\n\\n Pros- kid can play glow in semi dark pool while you enjoy a Sam Adams. Only one of my kids likes pool, so our routine is to get a pool table, take advantage of the 14.99 for an entree and one hour game card special and send the more down to earth sibling out into arcade area, while we show off our non existent pool skills. \\n\\n Everyone\\'s happy and filled up on pizza, fish and chips, or whatever other choice kids make. Bowling alley, where pool tables are, is usually empty and mysterious, if you are looking for ambiance. Smells like feet, as God intended.\\n There are also daily specials and happy hours and such for the value minded. Also, pool counts as PE, right? I homeschool, so PE credit is important. \\n\\n Cons- pool games are far from cheap. $9/hour is making me seriously consider ditching the family poker table and investing into a nice \"I\\'m over my man cave\" Craig\\'s list second hand-me-down.\\n\\n Another con is coordinating everything. We play at odd hours, so staff is light. Between hitting up one spot for pool balls, ordering food from another, juggling ID held for pool balls and ID required before Mr Sam Adams is brought out, it takes some logistical talent before everything falls into place. I learned to settle the bill upon ordering so that the ants in the pants sibling can get her hands on the game card early in the experience. \\n I just go with assumption everything will go smoothly from there and throw caution to the wind. \\n\\n If you want to know about the food- it\\'s frozen and fried, ok? Just like kids like it. Don\\'t come here looking for culinary experience, shuffle over to Brio, you grown up, you. \\n\\n In short, it\\'s where you can take the kids when they\\'ve outgrown Chuk e Cheese, and I am OK with that.', \"I like this place i have one problem tho i couldn't get serves at the gaming  area and kids run around every where here but otherwise its nice\", \"This place is a joke. 50% of the games are out of service. I'm taking my business to D & Bs\", \"Stopped by with the kiddies to take a break from the strip and was pleasantly surprised. Everything was clean and the staff was friendly. The reason for only 4 stars is a few of the games didn't work and there weren't any signs indicating this so we lost credits. Also, I used an amazing Groupon deal - I don't know if I'd come back without it. On a side note, the prize selection for tickets is great- lots of items at different values.\", 'I can\\'t give an all too extensive review because we were mostly secluded in the billiards area of the main bar (by the entry way). It was date night but there was a long pause between dinner and the movie so we tried our hand at gaming. We walked through, a lot of seemingly unsupervised teens but no issues and a few families. We decided on pool and beers. It was $5 per hour for the table and about $6.50 per beer, but of course. The table was a little rough but we weren\\'t auditioning for \"The Color of Money\" so no worries. If the bartender had been more attentive (or the bar back to be specific), we\\'d have spent a lot more to keep the beer flowing. It also took a bit to check out and settle the table tab, because again, the Bar Back was preoccupied with... something, whatever it was, keeping his conversation with fellow employees on point and fairly oblivious to customers. The bar was pretty empty for a Friday evening. Overall,  an \\'okay\\' experience for a limited one.', 'The E-Sports section is the true gem of Gameworks. $4 an hour (when you spend $20), tons of games on PC, XBox One, PS4  & Wii U, and discounted prices on food. \\n\\nAmazing value for lots of family fun!', \"This place is a zoo. It's loud and dark and very very busy. The food is mediocre. It's a difficult place to keep track of kids. They do have a lot of TVs if you want to watch sports.\", 'Had an awesome time here. :) food was nomm, wings, nachos and not to mention the smores dessert! The staff here is always friendly, attentive and it is clear that they love their job. That speaks volumes about the management here - love coming here and will return soon!', \"I remember having so much fun when Gameworks was on The Strip back in the 90's but they closed their doors for reasons I can't remember. But they oepened at Town Square a few decades later...now, I feel ancient.\\n\\nThe initial scent of sweaty gym socks and piss as soon as you walk in only lasts about 5 minutes then, you get used to the smell. To the left, is an area where you can pick out your prize and to the right is a virtual gaming room for those who love PC games. Straight ahead are arcade games, circus games, simulators, Air Hockey, photo booth, etc. To the right and towards the back are private rooms for events and parties. At the very back is the bar/restaurant.\\n\\nI've been here for a work function and so, we were in a private room. I was pleasantly surprised by the food they served us: chicken marsala, salads, braised beef with veggies, and funnel cakes. They also had more items on the menu. I was expecting pizza, fries, nachos, hotdogs and other junk. We had 2-hour game cards - those don't work on games that could instantly win you a prize (like those machines with claws that grab a toy) and the photobooth. Your time starts dwindling down as soon as you use it.\\n\\nI felt the need to re-live my youth and play games that I loved as a kid: Street Fighter (hadouken! Tiger uppercut! Sonic boom! Face bite! Helicopter kick!), Air Hockey, DDR and of course, Super Shot - that basketball shooting game. I would spend hours playing Super Shot...that has not changed the few times I've been to Gameworks. I get so into it like you don't even know. Sweat, focus, hand-eye coordination and a little tippy toe so i could see where the ball is going. I got hit on the head with a loose basketball by the kid 2 spaces away from me and I'm still going. I'd wake up the next day with my shoulders and calves feeling sore - but oh my gosh, it's so fun! I got people watching me when I play - I'm either such a badass at playing or there isn't a free hoop to shoot.\\n\\nI tried all of the other games when I got tired. I got challenged to play Air Hockey by my sister and a few other people - I owned every single one of them.\\n\\nBut what I'd like to know is: what is that green phallic thing they have for prizes?\", \"This place is a shell of its former self. Game works used to be a great place to go to for gaming.  I came here with my son because I remember as a teenager this place being the shit at its former location in Vegas but now that it's in this location it just isn't what it used to be. My son had fun regardless but I was just thrown off at how basic its become.\", \"Being a gamer I had to check out this place. I've never been to the original GameWorks, but this place wasn't as bad as I had expected. My gf and I stopped by here to check out some of the old arcade and VR games. The prices are bit high for the games and drinks are pricey as well. Overall its a place to check out once.\", \"I have a love-hate with GameWorks. After the opening of the competitor in downtown Summerlin, I have formed new opinions. \\n\\nI love that they participate in the Pogo Pass program,  love the bowling & the bar.\\n\\nI'm not so thrilled on their unlimited hour option, as the timer delays so you have to be very patient. You also don't retain any points for prizes with the unlimited option. \\n\\nOn the bright side, I have seen some great deals on Groupon for GameWorks. I also like how it's a great kid-friendly atmosphere but adults can also let loose with a drink at the bar. \\n\\nI'm here somewhat often only for the kiddos, but I wouldn't mind checking other options for kid time.\", \"I don't care what anyone says, I had an amazing time here. Although it's not as big as the old gameworks on the strip, there are still plenty of enjoyable games for any age limit. Unfortunately the first game I played had a little problem and it wasn't working at all, so I wanted to speak to a manager about it because I didn't receive the points I won. The manager, Charles was so polite and friendly. He eventually refunded our points and had a tech to fix the game. It's my favorite game so far.\", \"Friday night was the fourth or fifth time I have stopped by Gameworks. It's on my way home from work so I meet up with friends there occasionally. I always have a great time.  Whether it's playing the games with my friends,  bowling, or hanging out at the bar, it's fun.  The staff has always been friendly and helpful.  The food is yummy,  especially the chicken nachos,  and the bartenders are a lot of fun, especially the chick with the skull tattoo. Check it out. Make sure you play the Pacman air hockey game,  it's crazy.\", \"It's nice to see Gameworks back in Vegas, since I remember going to the old location on the strip. By comparison,  this new location is a ton newer but also smaller. It's nice to see that everything isn't falling apart and all the games are clean and actually work!\\n\\nI'm not sure though why they made the restaurant area so large because Gameworks is usually an arcade first and restaurant second. I've been to multiple locations around the country and all of them have a much much larger gaming area than restaurant. The restaurant also has a ton of wasted space that could've been used to accommodate games so that it doesn't feel as cramped inside when you're playing. The only thing I like about the restaurant is the TVs and projector screens they have all around. Makes this a great place to watch sports!\\n\\nThe games themselves are decent although not a whole lot seemed to spark my interest. Most of them are pretty expensive too, costing approximately 7-12 credits. Each credit is 25 cents unless you buy in large dollar amounts such as $50-100.\\n\\nOverall Gameworks at Town Square is a good place to hang out or kill some time, but wouldn't be a place I'd visit frequently.\", \"It's SO nice to have Game Works back! Wish it were as big as the old location on the Strip, but this is a nice modern twist, and in a great location. \\n\\nBowling, video games, photo booths, basketball hoop game (worth mentioning because its my favorite) drinks and food. Almost as good as Dave & Buster's. Kids loved it, Mom and Dad liked sitting in the restaurant area and letting the kids wreak havoc. Just kidding! We aren't *those* parents... well, at least not on that day =)\", \"Yelp, you really need to stop removing my reviews just because I don't agree with everyone else. I don't feel like typing it all out again, but basically I'm giving the place five stars because I think it's a great addition to TS, and you can make a fun night of it between AMC, this, and Blue Martini. You could spend hours at TS because of those three places. Yes, some games were broken, but I'll give them a few months to work out the glitches. I also see the arcade expanding in the future because the restaurant doesn't seem to be that popular, but the rest of the arcade is. Peace.\", '3D games no 3D glasses, about %25 of games or more are out of order, save your money. I always leave nice reviews when deserved. The bar looked good for adults and their new XD Dark Ride was the only fun game all other games are very outdated. We will not be returning very boring they need to put more experience games not worth the money hope management reads this and they make it fun for people one day.', \"Here's the thing I've never really experienced GameWorks before, even back when it was on the Strip, and I've never been to a Dave and Busters so all of this is new to me. Anyways I've been to this location more than a few times and honestly I like it.\\n\\nThey have a bowling alley, a bar and restaurant, lots of arcade games, you can earn tickets and redeem them for prizes, billiard tables, lots of screens to catch a sports game playing, and even computer and console games area. You can play at the billiards tables for $5 an hr.\\n\\nFood is your usual bar food I guess there's pizzas, burgers, chicken tenders, sandwiches, salads, etc. They even have a deal where certain items on the menu comes with an hr play of the arcade for like $15 and you can use the cards anytime for 1 hr straight. I kind of have been stashing them cause I have 3 cards.\\n\\nSeems like a great place for families and people of all ages. Haven't had a bad experience yet and customer service has always been great. I'll definitely be back.\", \"I just can't find my way into giving 5 stars to a place that co-mingles alcohol and children. Having said that, I am an adult that likes to obtain the occasional cocktail, and I was pleasantly surprised with the level of service from what I can easily see as a great bartender: Erica Gueco. She was nice, personable, amiable, and attentive to my needs, all while expertly handling of the needs of the many other patrons. She is a credit to this establishment and a great person to have on the front lines. Though, with all the great food joints perched so closely to this place, and the general lack of consistency I've experienced here as far as the menu goes, I would have to say pass on the food. Just get drinks, from Erica if you're lucky.\", \"Bad bad bad bad. I grew up near the Seattle Gameworks. One of my favorite spots. Good food, great venue, great service, great arcade.  \\n\\nThe new Townsquare GameWorks is none of those things. This location is an offense to the reputation they've built.\\n\\nFood: 0/5. It didn't get my sick. That's the absolute best thing I can say about it. The Nachos and Pizza were far, far worse than 7/11. Yes, the pizza you get at 7/11 is leaps and bounds better than what's served at the Town Square GW. The Nachos were better in Middle School. No, I'm not exaggerating. It's edible\\n\\nService: despite half the restaurant being empty, the server informed us it would be a 20 minute wait. When I pointed out that fact that 2/3 of the restaurant was empty, she told me she was short of servers and just couldn't do it(I've worked in two high end restaurants in my life, and that is pure comedy.) There was one large party, and five other tables. I saw a minimum of five servers. There was enough staff to cover a 50 table restaurant and they made us wait so the servers wouldn't get stuck with more than a couple tables at a time. I talked to the manager who at first seemed to be shocked, then did nothing about it. The server was fairly polite but the host and manager ruined it.\\n\\nArcade: Decent. Far below the other GWs I've been to.\\n\\nThere's a reason there was no adult parties here alone. Only kids or parents with their kids. The service is God awful and the food is below gas station fare. The Seattle location is always packed and has more adults than kids. Take a lesson from them. \\n\\nIf you've ever been to a chuckee cheese in the 90s, think of that, with way worse pizza, 5x more expensive food and gaming, and god awful service.\", 'My review was removed by Yelp (presumably by mgmt complaint) because I didn\\'t provide enough detail.  So I\\'m rewriting my review, per the \"yelp community\" request.\\n\\nI\\'ve been here before and the service on the restaurant side is less than desirable.  My most recent visit started of course walking to the front to be seated even though the tables are empty.  I was seated at a booth and there were crumbs.  As though the table was wiped down but some debris was left behind.  Adjacent to my booth was another booth with dirty plates/drinks etc. (like everyone placed the dirty dishes at one table to gather together).  Waitress proceeded to \"handle\" the dirty dishes then bring me water.  Didn\\'t see her wash her hands, but she may have.\\n\\nFood comes (not too long of a wait) and it\\'s missing some stuff.  No biggy, just said hey, missing this and this.  I would of told the guy who delivered the food but he said \"food\" left the tray on the table and quickly left.\\n\\nKeep in mind I\\'m still missing stuff from my food, the waitress has been told, then she goes to other tables.  Kind of hard to eat my salad without dressing.  I wait and get it, no big deal.\\n\\nFood was ok, depending on what you get.  Better off eating elsewhere then going here to play games (assuming you have kids like me)\\n\\nHappy Yelp community?!?!?! Lol', 'An adult chuckie cheese in my eyes, there is always a special deal during the week. Lots of prizes and games. Great place to go and have fun and hang out.', \"I am only reviewing the arcade as I haven't tried the restaurant or bowling. Alot of arcades seem to be taking that approach these days (i.e. Round 1, KDB, Latitude 39). I came here for a Smash 4 Tournament and tried the arcade out between my sets.\\nThe game selection is small like many reviewers already stated, but the games they do have work well. They even have a Pump It Up Infinity that works amazingly well. I would like to see more Japanese games out here like Beatmania and Pop n' Music since the Gemini arcade palace closed. Overall, Gameworks Las Vegas is a small, underrated arcade that deserves more positive attention than it is getting.\", 'My husband and I wanted to give our kids one last day of fun before school started back up again so we decided to treat them to a day of fun at Gameworks.    \\nAs we walked in we were greeted by an adorable young lady who explained the different options for purchasing game cards for the children to use to play the games.  I\\'m not sure which \"package\" my husband purchased but it was the perfect amount for keeping the kids happy and busy for a few hours!  I don\\'t remember the last time my kids had this much fun.  After an hour and a half or so we decided to sit down and grab a bite to eat.  The kids each got a cheeseburger and fries and my husband and I shared a couple of flatbread pizzas.  We were VERY impressed with the quality of the food we received.  Our server, I can\\'t remember her name, was an absolute doll.  The food came out quickly and hot.  We will definitely be back to try more of the menu items in the future.  A manager even stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our visit.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a fantastic experience for my husband and I as well as our kids who have been begging to go back since we left.  Thanks Gameworks!', \"Went there last night to have a few drinks before a movie. Bartender was very unfriendly. (Girl with blue streaks in her hair) Didn't make us feel welcome, she seemed put out if we asked her anything, and just gave bad vibes all around. She was also slamming cabinets and drawers, seems as if she dragged her body along. Someone working in the hospitality industry shouldn't be so miserable. Makes you wonder about management as well. There's tons of bars in this city! Will not be back\", 'Game Works should lower their pricing and give more credits when kids/adults are playing at this establishment. They give stingy credits when playing and you spend most of your money on it and get nothing in return. You are ripping off customers!!!', \"Well this place was a disappointment. Bought the groupon deal. Was incredibly confusing with two cards and figuring out which machines to use which cards. Sometimes the cards worked and then they wouldn't. You don't win tickets with the Groupon card deal and there is a ton of machines just to roll or spin for more tickets which is pointless on the deal. Place is not clean and everything feels extremely run down! So many out of order machines and some that didn't even have out of order placards but didn't work! Would not come here again unless they did some serious updating.\", 'We spent a whole day at the arcade during our stay in Vegas!

I was looking forward to this place for a year, total disappointment. Any arcade on the strip is just as good if not better. Over priced games! Very small areas, everyone was cramped tight and I almost lost my composure in there due to the fact that the arcade area is so small and when playing skee ball was afraid to play with confidence due to trying to a avoid bumping in to someone while playing.

Just terrible\", \"There are way too many ticket machines which require no skill and attract little kids to use up all their quarters! I wish all the games gave tickets so they would actually play games besides ticket machines! A lot of machines were out of order. There were so many people in there you had to wait to get a turn on most games. This was Sat. at 4:00 p.m.-5:30. This place is just prepping young kids to throw away their money in hopes of hitting the 500 ticket pay out! Sound like Vegas to you?  They serve alcohol, that's a plus! They have a few bowling lanes, and kids loved that! At least they played something. They also have a small video game room with some game system for older kids. I didn't check that out much, and have no idea how long that's been there. The food is very good here. Plan on spending a lot of money if you take a few kids here at once. It's cheaper to purchase one or two large play cards than purchasing 5 different ones. So we got two and had the teens swipe for the 10 year olds.

Great for kids, teens and adults.', \"You know what, I had a good experience at GameWorks! I think that there could be more games (there was a pretty large, and empty, dining area), but it was clean, well maintained, and the games they had were quite entertaining.

Although they don't have a DJ and dance floor like they do at Insert Coins, this was still a good time.\\n\\nI also liked that they had a full bar with drinks that weren't overpriced.

Their happy hour, i think they have two, always hits the spot and the food is a great price and the quality is better than the strip for some items.  I kept it simple and just got the bbq bacon burger. I know, but im a burger guy. It was one of the best I've had. Sometimes you get them and they are outrageously big or dry or pricey, but this one was phenomenal.  The bartender was great at making a Cadillac margarita and quick with the food and any refills.

There is a section for PC and console games as well as a section for bowling. The bar area is a good size with plenty of seating inside and outside of the store. The seats also aren\\'t located next to the games so it\\'s nice not having people constantly walk around you while you eat (unlike Dave and Buster\\'s).\\n\\nThe only downside is that these games are expensive because you pay with \"points.\" I suggest buying the package deal where you have unlimited play for 1 hour.

Still a nice off Strip option for kids, but I hope the games are updated and repaired soon.', \"This place is fun, I got a great deal on Groupon and was like heck yeah I'm 30 and I don't care if I'm seen playing them arcade games all day for free lol!!!

Over the course of an hour and a half my kids had easily accumulated nearly 2,000 tickets when we got to the cash out the girl at the register said we only had 320 tickets. My son played the fish game like 10 times alone and hit the 500 grand prize and 150 twice the girl said oh the machine isn't working then maybe put an out of order sheet on it.  Needless to say my kids got hosed and were upset about not being able to get what they wanted.  I even offered to just buy the toys they wanted and again the girl said uh we can't do that.  If I could give no stars I would.  BUYER BEWARE!\", \"E-sports section of Gameworks  is the real gem. I bring my son all the time and every  employee that works there is awesome!

Can't beat that.\", \"I was trying to have a good day with son, but a lot of games kept malfunctioning . Here's why Star is low , because when I got a credit back from manager from a broken game , he made no effort to place a sign on game so the next person wouldn't get ripped off. If I was close to game, I would tell a gamer not to play, but throughout time I was there , I saw several kids getting ripped off, but they would just walk away, I guess the manager knew that someone like me, asking for credit back was rare , so he was making money by just leaving game unfixed. Place stinks with odor, workers seem to not care, and manager acts like he's to good for his job. This place is just 'Hype'.\", \"This seemingly fun place that is hampered by a completely inept staff and a bunch of games in various states of disrepair.\\n\\nI could've gotten over the staff being crappy if I could just play games that actually worked.

There's arcade games,  bowling, pool, large tv's for sports, a bar, food; with all of that you're going to be entertained at some point. It's just like Dave and Buster's if you know what that is, but maybe a little better. I would definitely come back, and also suggest that you try it, cool place to hang out and there's so many other things within walking distance of this place(food,  bars, clubs, shopping, movie theater).\", \"Went to go see the hateful 8 at AMC and it was sold out...so my GF and I decided to stop at GameWorks after some post Xmas shopping. As an esports fan, I had to see that area. It's pretty cool to see GW recognize how big the esports industry really is. Upon entering, I was impressed by the variety, design and vibe of the esports area. I was greeted by Carlos, the manager, who told me that Alex and V (can't remember her full name) would take good care of us. They had amazing service and as we were playing Halo 5 I noticed V handle a group of loitering obnoxious teens (I rarely use this word, I'm still a big kid) like a pro. They made sure we were taken good care of. Well done everyone, will be back for sure. Very happy with my time spent there tonight.\", 'Honestly every time I go here the games are always broken and take my credits. It makes me sad.

I was trying to buy a couple rounds of drinks for my group of friends (6 people) before heading over to the games, but we ended up only doing 1 round (took at least 20 to 30 minutes from ordering drinks to actually getting the bill paid for). There were so many people trying to flag down the bartenders for food/drinks but there was not enough of them to provider service. I could have easily spent $100 more had there been a bartender, but we just got frustrated and left. \\n\\nThey had a good variety of games (ticket and non ticket), but the majority of them were broken.

This place could be so much better if the management would maintain the games better and hire more bartenders.\", \"This place is dirty and kind of gross. 1 out of every 3 machines/games I tried to play were broken, and I don't think you get good value in the swipe card. \\n\\nThe temperature in here was too high, and there was a sweaty feel to the air. Everything was sticky! I was hard pressed to find a safe spot to set down my purse, haha jk, I mean my jacket. \\n\\nMy girl and I made the best of our adventure here, but overall left disappointed, because this place has potential, and if they don't step up, clean up and get their machines working, I don't think this place will last.\", 'I\\'m not a \"gamer\", but I do enjoy a fun atmosphere, drinking yummy cocktails, and trying new things which is exactly what GameWorks in Town Square offered.

There are tons and tons of games to play, my favorite was the frog log jump and the Terminator one!! They also have ski ball and a basket ball shooting game. For those of you faithful gamers they even have an entire room set up for online/computer games where you can play til your hearts content while sipping cocktails. My favorite part is their full bowling lanes!! \\n\\nWhen you\\'re ready to wet your whistle they also have a large full bar with a full menu. My visit happened to be their second day of being open, so their food was still needing some tweaking, however everything I ate did have great flavor.

Yes I can understand that it was gonna be busy because of the fact that it was a saturday but that\\'s not my gripe.\\n\\nMy gripe is that a lot of the games were not working. I would say about 40 percent were out of order. Even some of the newer games like the tank one my youngest noticed you can only go forward and cannot reverse so he was stuck behind a wall the whole game not able to do anything but get shot at. Another gripe is that other parents had the same idea so of course my kids had to wait for their kids to get off a game once they ran out of lives but in most cases, they would just keep swiping their card basically just hogging the game the whole time. There should be some kind of limit on how many times you can continue on an all day play pass for they can literally stay on a game the whole day which is rude in my opinion.\\n\\nI also understand that since we had the unlimited play card it wouldnt generate any game tickets for obvious reasons. This did not bother me at all. Again, since some of the games were out of order, the kids tried to make the most of it. Even the standard interactive games like the basketball shot one only 4 out of the 6 was working but technically only 2 was worthy of playing due to those having a decent amount of balls to play with while the others had only 2 or 3. Looking around I saw some of the balls were stuck on top of the actual arcade. \\n\\nAfter about 90 minutes of playing the same games over and over again my kids were bored already to the point they just wanted to go home. Memo to the Gameworks staff. Dont you guys have some kind of technician that is on the clock repairing those games that are broke? At least a person that can keep the basketballs in order on the basketball arcade?\\n\\nI am so disappointed from our visit that I dont see any reason to come back here.

I was definitely expecting more since it moved from the MGM location to Town Square. I personally think the old location had more to offer and that this one needs more \"punch\" to really get people in. There was not enough newer games out on the floor and I can see that they are trying to copy Dave & Busters theme. A lot of dated machines and maybe they can add some pool tables in the dining area to give other options. I left a little underwhelmed and hope they do more with the space.', 'Great deal if........All the games worked also a lot of outdated older machines made it disappointed. \\n\\nNeed to step up game because food and games are better at Dave and Busters.\\n\\nSorry Gameworks but thought I should know', 'This is not the quality that I expected to come of GameWorks. \\n*Purchased an all day pass that had errors reading the card so the card had to be replaced. \\n*The advertised 24 hour unlimited play on Groupon card only works for 14 hours. \\n*The staff was very young and inexperienced with customer service. \\n*Beware that many games have malfunction issues.

Very disappointed.\", \"Meh!  Came here for the 1st time today to see if it would be a good option for a birthday party.  Boy, was I disappointed!  About a third of the games did not work!  It is pricey, but my kids love the games so I wasn't worried too much about the cost.  This place is quite small, I was expecting something larger.  From reading the reviews, they obviously don't care about fixing their games.  The place seemed clean though, employees nice, but detached and worried about taking selfies with giant stuffed animals.\", \"Great place for kid's parties. I recently attended one, where the family rented out a large room that had plenty of space for guests and tables full of pizza, wings, Philly cheesesteak egg rolls, and bruchetta. The food wasn't anything special, but that's to be expected from a place that focuses on games and entertainment. The employees working the party were friendly and attentive, regularly making sure food and drinks were restocked. The kids at the party were given cards that entitled them to 2 hours of game play on almost all games. Even on a Friday night there were plenty of games available with little to no wait times.\", \"I had time to check this place out last night.  The four of us had dinner there and then enjoyed some games.\\n\\nThe service at dinner was great.  The server acknowledged they had only been open for about three weeks, and they were continuing to take any feedback to improve the experience.  \\n\\nThe shareable crab cake was delicious, but the portion needs to be shipped off!  If you get it,  don't feel ashamed to be a bit greedy as the $14 cake is just that, one expensive cake!  HOWEVER,  the chicken nachos!  You can't go wrong!  \\n\\n The entrees were interesting.  I got the beef rib dish.  It's not something usual for me, but I took the server's advice (he was a good guy).  I found the meat to be a bit fatty.  I found enough tasty pieces to satisfy...  The most unsettling part of the dish was the way the meal was garnished.  Imagine the sword in the stone...  But it was the rib-bone jammed into the pile of wasabi mashed potatoes.  Different.\\n\\nThe beer selection was ok...  Just too expensive (I understand the place is on the strip).  I think I could have walked across the way to a competing place, and it would have been more affordable.\\n\\nThe game variety was fun (I stink at video games) ,and I enjoyed pinball.  The pacman air hockey will either make you pull a muscle or lose an eye!  It is not to be missed!  \\n\\nAfter speaking to a few staff members, it's clear they are working to adjust things.  I'll give them a few weeks and will try them again.  \\n\\nBe patient!  I think the place will compete for your attention soon!  Huge TV and video walls will be sure have your favorite sports games available. \\n\\nOh yeah, there is bowling and computer games there too (not sure what those are all about).\", 'First off I\\'d like to thank the kid Nick at game work who helped me out with my misplaced order of pizza that was given away to some other kid in the internet cafe. The manager Joseph totally blew me off when I tried to talk to him. At least act like your listening instead of just saying \"uh, huh. We got you\" . By the way I did not know that he was the manager until after my order was fixed. \\n\\n    . I tried to tell Joseph which computer My brother, son and I was sitting.  We waited about 30 mins for a personal size looking pizza.  Nick came and check on us 2 times as he always makes his rounds around the cafe every time I\\'ve visted.  Finally I asked for his help which he got done faster than Joseph has. Nick completely took care of my brother and son after. But he is just a great up beat worker overall every time we have gone into game works he has been helpful and always checking on the kids. Great and attentive.  Joseph it was nice giving me the reason why things weren\\'t done. BUT NICK GOT THEM DONE FOR US. As well as the other 2 employees that was with him.', \"The games are nice and the place is clean but the rest is horrible. This is NOT even in the same category as Dave and Busters. I've had bar food that was better. This was gas station quality food. The nachos literally had gas station canned cheese on it. My son had the steak salad. He couldn't even chew the meat. Then we had a birthday coupon that had to be approved by the manager. That took 20 minutes.  Save your money.\", 'Jonathan mahr is the baddest dude on the planet!

Pricing is alright for the portions you get. I wouldn't eat here again. I would just grab food somewhere in the plaza. \\n\\nLocation: Great area, located right next to the movie theater. You get the best of both worlds. Teenagers, kids and adults can all enjoy a movie then come here afterwards. \\n\\nGames: Variety of games to play. From winning tickets or just playing multiplayer. Most of the games are up to date and new. They still have some of your old school arcade games as well. A small bowling alley is located inside and a cool ride inside as well that is extra money. They even have one of those motion rides where you can seat yourself.\\n\\nOverall, not too bad but still feels like they are missing something.\", \"I want to give a shout out to Ron the Mgr and his team at GAMEWORKS for the most excellent time we had at their establishment. Hawaiian Airlines recently had our holiday party held there on Jan 21st and it was the best party EVER!!! Ron made sure the party went on with no worries and no problems. Lets not forget their delicious food we ate Pizzas cheese and Meathead pizza's, kids favorite sliders, calamari, chicken tenders, chicken wings, and their chicken cobb salad and caesar salad was a hit with everyone. Our families enjoyed themselves and we definitely recommend any company or families who are looking for a place to hold their events at.

Porky Joe's and Carnival Chicken sandwich was to die for. With some yukon fries topped with blue cheese crumbles and bacon was definitely a treat. I would also like thank the manager, Ron.

We went to the bar and sat down. A server named Elizabeth decided to serve everyone around me, even patron that walked up after. She looked right in our faces & chose to serve a patron that just walked up. I went down to the other end, and the manager had to tell someone to serve us. Really? After 15 minutes? The bar area was not that crowded. Overall, I will not be returning here. We left to go find a place that was willing to serve us food and drinks. There's no way I will spend another dime in this place. Horrible service!!!\", \"Okay, so it may not be that big and it's not what most of us had expected but they had to use the space they were given. I have heard they are expanding and since I've been back, they had added several more games along with fixing the broken games. Although they may not have had what I expected, I'm still happy with going to Gameworks and playing their games.\\n\\nThe service is pretty good except I did find it annoying when the barista in the bowling area would rather be texting on her phone or flirting with the one guy behind the bar than serving other customers. I had to ask the bowling attendants to get my drink. I understand it's slow, but it would be nice if someone looked up occasionally. But the rest of the staff are very nice and helpful.\", \"This is a great place for kids of all ages to play a wide variety of arcade games, ranging from high-end video games (sit inside of a capsule, with wrap-around screens) right down to those silly games you find at other venues that spit out paper tickets you can redeem for nearly worthless prizes.  Needless to say, there's something here for everyone, including even gaming consoles!\\n\\nIf you're there over mealtime, there's also a bar and a full-service restaurant within the facility.  We didn't partake at the bar, so I'll leave that for others to review.  The food was average at best, and the although the hostess and waitstaff were friendly, it was very clear that none of them were enthusiastic about being there.  Even with a lot of open tables, it took over 30 minutes to seat our party, and when they did, the tables were cleared but still dirty.  It appeared everyone wanted to be working somewhere else, or not at all.  This strikes me as odd since GameWorks is located in Town Square and is essentially surrounded by other dining options.  With average food and below average staff, and access to a big variety of food within just a few minutes walking distance, it seems GameWorks might want to stick to its primary purpose and make better use of the space by putting in a small snack bar, and using the rest of the floor space for more games.\\n\\nI'll definitely go back with my son to play more games, but we won't eat there again.  No point paying the price for decent food but being served mediocre food when there are so many other options right there.  So go to game, not to eat.\", \"Sure, I like video games & especially the nostalgia invoked of playing Pac-Man, etc. in the 80s. My hands don't move that fast now but it's still fun! You have to remember that this is a place for the kiddos so it will be crazy/loud etc. If that gets to be too much, they do have adult beverages. In case you haven't been to an arcade since the 80s, they now have cards onto which they load 30, 60 minutes etc. of play time. So you can leave the quarters at home! \\n\\nI've been here a few times for various events, and for my birthday last year after they sent me a deal for free gaming for up to 6 people for 30 minutes and a birthday treat from the restaurant for me!

I'm a skee ball fan and also prefer the racing games (of which they have a few here) and so that was an enjoyable birthday stop!\", 'Love this place. Plenty of games. Not too crowded.

Birthday parties have many options like: dedicated packages with your own room or u can reserve a table in the restaurant area. \\nWe chose a table and added balloons, Andre was our server. I remember this because he was just so friendly and attentive! I felt like we were his only party.. Which we were not! \\nThere was two other large groups having parties the same time. It was not bad thou.\\nThere is no dedicated \"kids menu\". However we found the Pizza and GameWorks nachos are large enough for kids to share or for an adult as a meal. (The steak on the nachos was very tender and was flavorful.) Each of these seemed kid friendly and were a part of the Play and Eat combo menu (so you could have opted to get a 1 hour timed game card for about $2.99 more if you were coming outside a party package- plus $2 card activation if it\\'s your first time getting a card). \\nHowever the other menu items are mostly adult game day kind of foods or high end restaurant type meals, that would be great for a night watching sports/ or a girls night out. Not a lot of options small kids ( like hotdogs, mac and cheese etc.) I am usually an avid \"Yelper\" and had been slightly concerned prior to our arrival, about food quality and service, due to some older reviewers. My mind was quickly changed! \\nI had to talk with the chef in advance of ordering because of food allergies and he was very professional and reassuring.  He said they had a new menu starting presidents day with several new items ( like mac and cheese balls), and that the kitchen had changed a lot since opening ( which happens a lot now that I think about restaurants I frequent). He was right that things must have changed, because the quality far exceeded the reviews I had read. I had no problem getting food everyone could eat (despite allergies) and Andre refilled my drink 4 times in the 40 mins. we sat to eat.\\n       \\nInside the Arcade:\\nFamily friendly atmosphere; Plenty of room for our stroller. We even saw a few double strollers while we were there! The family bathroom has a koala changing station.

It was pretty cheap compared to HI. Also, the bowling alley was really fun.', 'Was here for my husbands birthday with family and friends. Best service from Jerred. Great food...great atmosphere!!! Will be coming back again', \"GameWorks is back in town and I am happy. I'm not much of a gamer myself but coming here brings the inner kid out of me. Here is my take on the place.\\n\\nLocation: I love the new location in Town Square compared to the old location on the strip. It is below the AMC movie theatre and across from Yard House. It is close to a bunch of good bars and restaurants. Here are a few: Yard House, Capriotti's, Mcfaddens, Sugar Factory. \\n\\nInterior: When you walk in the front doors there is a service station to your left and a seating area, there is also seating on the exterior if you prefer that. The bar is 20ft from the front door. The bar was average in size with a good selection of alcohol, we ordered a jack with coke and Malibu mix drink, both were $6 so that's not bad. Then you have a decent selection of arcade games and various other gaming machines, there was a variation of air hockey which would throw out about 20 mini discs at once, now that was fun and intense. There was a glow in the dark pool table area and bowling lanes which I did not try but will next time.\\n\\nStaff: The bar staff was good. There was a hipster looking white male who made us feel at home, explained the changes to the new menu, and helped us when needed. There was a short hispanic male who was in the bar area and didn't seem to do much, I'm not sure if he was the manager but he was rude to the staff and extremely bossy. The staff at the ticket counter were good and helped us get the correct amount of points on our card after a machine error.\\n\\nWe will be back soon to try the glow in the dark things and as the drinks are $2 cheaper than Mcfaddens which is upstairs.\", 'My kids love to come here. They have a lot of games and is very clean. employers are really profesional and friendly.', \"Place is fun for the kids.. but bought an unlimited game card but a LOT of the games were broken, in need of servicing or unavailable.  it's like saying all you can eat but not put out any food..  sheesh\", \"I'd recommend going in while they have their daily specials. (Have different ones for different days)\\nIf you remember the GameWorks that was on the strip, this place won't be as spacious and more condensed. Still offers tickets/prizes. Wish they had more games they had in their previous location :( choices pretty much were racing or shooting + the sport arcades. \\nKeep you gamecard so with the next visit, you can reload the card and not pay for an extra.\\n\\nIf you plan on spending some time at the bar, plenty of TV's!! The food is rather pricey, so I'd recommend waiting till happy hour (starts 9pm) \\nYou honestly can't expect any service if you're at the bar just keep that in mind. You might see someone right when you order, then they disappear.\", 'Went the other night and our server Sahara was amazing. Will definately go to gameworks again.', \"I've come here a few times for family parties and it's always a good time! It's a great place for kids and adults to have fun. The most recent visit there was a problem with our time card and the manager Ron took care of it quickly without any problems. This is definitely a place a would recommend to other families!\", 'Gave this place a 2. It does deserve to have a 2 because of where it\\'s located, being the fact that Town Square is my second home. After hours of shopping with the kiddos, they deserve to have their fun. \\n\\nOther than that.... This new game works is super boring, not enough games, my kids were bored 20 mins into playing. \\n\\nFOOD is crap. They don\\'t even have the option of getting a whole pizza like the old Game Works at MGM. Only a pan size personal pizza for $14. Nachos with \"string\" like shredded chicken which had no taste and hardly anything on them. \\n\\nSERVICE. Well, wasn\\'t too great. Had to call her to order and since it was our first time at this location, we had a lot of questions about the menu, and she was a little irritated with our questions. We then finally ordered. We got 2 pepperoni pizzas and chicken nachos. \\n\\nShe told us if we added $3 more dollars to each of our items, we would get a free play card. So it would\\'ve been perfect for not buying more play cards. So we did add the $3 special for the card play, but she didn\\'t mention to us until after we won at least 10,000 points on games that it wouldn\\'t be included on their dinner play cards. \\n\\nNot only did the server and this place ruin our dinner, but made my kiddos cry for not getting any prizes they\\'ve earned on those games. \\n\\nNEVER AGAIN WILL I BE BACK.', 'Alysia with a heart and not a .

The previous strip location had so much more to offer and it was a letdown to see how very little this new location had. The prices for all the games also seemed quite unreasonable and it was even more disappointing when almost half of the games were down for maintenance.', 'Great place for the whole family ...this is an awesome place to go with the whole family .

The pizza was good, the kids loved it. The one hour game card does not include collecting tickets for prizes. You can play those games, however the kids do not get tickets. What a rip off. The kids were pissed and do not want to go back. \\nIt was not explained to us by the waitress nor do any of the signs mention this little caveat.', 'Fun atmosphere and plenty of games to play.  The food is okay and everyone who works here are friendly and helpful.  A great time was had by all.', 'Food is pretty good. We got chicken fingers which came with fries. The pizza was thin and simple. The kids really enjoyed it. We did the Dine and play which really saves you money. I wish they would have just the hour game play but you have to buy the food.', \"I'm been in the hospitality industry for 12 years, so take my opinion as you wish.\\n\\nLocation is better than before, but much smaller.  I will never eat there again.  Food was bad not to mention cold.  We were the only ones there, should have been a hint, and the service was so slow you would think the place was packed.  I may take my son back to play, but wouldn't touch the food, especially with so many options in town square.  I've seen many of my customers with infinitely better food and atmosphere close shop.  Unless something drastically changes, I don't see this place lasting.\", 'My kids love this place, used Groupon deal for all day gaming with no issues what so ever.', 'Before I continue, I would like to say that this review is regarding only the arcade portion of this GameWorks. After hearing everyone\\'s excitement about the new GameWorks opening up and seeing the sign posted inside of TownSquare for over a year, I thought this place was going to be spectacular. I was definitely let down. \\n\\nFirst of all, the space for the games is just too small. You could run through them all in just a couple of hours. That is, if you get a chance to play them at all. It\\'s always crowded with so many people and sometimes you\\'ll find parents just taking up the chairs for the games to watch their children play.\\n\\nSecond, not only are the cards/points extremely overpriced for an arcade but, the self help kiosks don\\'t even work and when we went to inform the employees at the ticket counter, they just shrugged and said \"They never work\".\\n\\nThis brings me to another point, a lot of the games are ALREADY broken! Why pay so much money for all of these points if everything is shut down? Ridiculous.\\n\\nLastly, if your children play enough games to earn enough points for a certain prize that they want, don\\'t let them get too excited. A couple of my friends spent just enough money to win enough tickets to get the LEGO pillow that they\\'ve been eyeing for a while. As soon as they reached the 1,500 ticket mark, they went to redeem their prize. Then, the employees told them they don\\'t even have the LEGO pillows in stock. Though a few different colors of them were hanging on the walls.\\n\\nI wish they could just open up a reasonably priced arcade. From now on, I\\'m sticking to the Pinball Hall of Fame.', \"Yeah a 3 rating sounds about right. The older location had more soul and passion. Albeit a fighting game or driving around. \\n\\nI love SEGA from the get go in the late 80's when I used to buy games from Tatget. Lol\\n\\nNow their games have dwindled and the competition isn't there any more. Although it looks like they have a new LAN center to hang out at. I have yet to bring my joystick with me to this. \\n\\nThe food is the exact same menu as the old place. Same OL same ol.\", \"Well like any other game works, you can expect to pay anywhere between $1 and $2.50 for a single credit of any game. It's very expensive but you can save a lot by purchasing time cards, this seems to be the way forward with any 'swipe card' location.\\n\\nMachines at this location are generally quite new, however, games can be out of order for months! I have no idea what the techs get up to here, but it certainly isn't machine fixing! When I ask for help fixing a game, they just put my credit back on my card and avoid the problem. Emailing the manager gets results, but we shouldn't have to right?!\\n\\nFood is pretty good actually, for bar food. Spending $15 can get you a 2 hour game card, so this is the way to go. They also have bowling and a gaming lounge, not my scene personally, but it's there!\\n\\nI give this location a 2 out of 5 due to the price and poor machine fixing. I will alter my review of this gets sorted out in the future\", \"I came here to blow through a pre-loaded one hour play pass on a Tuesday night with my husband. Surprisingly, the place was actually crowded. Our first order of business was to get a drink at the bar, and the drinks ain't cheap. All draft beers, regardless of type or brand, were $6.50. We ordered 2 Stella Artois and were served quick enough, but were thereafter virtually ignored by the staff.\\n\\nOnward to the arcade! We were disappointed when we realized we would NOT be earning any tickets for the night (because half the fun of going to arcades is collecting tickets to redeem random shit you'll never use). Anyhow, we had fun playing the games we would have never played if we were using a ticket generating game card. The arcade is smaller than I'd like- with most of the games, you had to race some 14 year old runt to play anything. \\n\\nI would really give Gameworks a 3.5 rating. They lose points for having expensive ass draft beers, poor service at the bar, and a limited section of games. All in all though, I would still return if I'm ever in the mood for it. I'll just get my drinks elsewhere!\", 'booooo the manager for locking door preventing people to cut across to Amc theater in the morning.  They use to let people walk across before. On gonna spread this to my friends and make this bad decision viral. You mess with the wrong crowd game works!', 'SO EXPENSIVE! Lol if you go here .. Bring a lot of money!! Btw the prizes are also so expensive you need to get a lot of tickets to get a stuff animal !!! Not really worth spending your money here tho..', \"SCAM ALERT!  I should probably give this place more than 1 star b/c there are things that I like.  But I have a difficult time when places are blatantly being cheap and cheating children and families.  \\n\\nSpecifically, I'm referring to their Wizard of Oz machine which is one of those coin dozer type games where you knock coins down.  This game was fun to us at first b/c it has cards that you can collect and if you manage to gather them all, you can turn them in for a ticket bonus of like 2000 tickets.  So I learn that the Toto dog card is the rarest of the bunch and there are only a few in each machine.  And obviously you need this card to complete the set and the ticket bonus.  Well obviously they are aware of this too b/c they literally have all of the Toto cards out of play.  How do I know this?  Because they are stupid enough to put them in the machines at the very top of the decks so that you can see that they are in there.  But the cards fall from the bottom and somehow the Toto card is always on top.  Not 1. Not 2. But 3 in plain view and out of play.  I have been in and out of there for over 6 months and just check as I walk by and they are still right there on top.  \\n\\nI would never accuse a place of being shady or trying to scam people without being sure... but I think 6 months straight is a fair amount of time to base my accusations.  I have pictures as proof on my other phone.  Who knows what other games they have rigged that aren't so obvious.  It's sad really that a business would be so cheap when it comes to winning a relatively small amount of tickets used to buy mostly junk toys.\\n\\nShame on Gameworks for taking a game that is expensive to play anyways and feeling the need to cheat children and families.  \\n\\nI'm taking my business to other places.  John's Incredible Pizza is a very good alternative for those that don't like to support shady businesses.\", \"Came here today with some friends and I had a blast. I like that there's a lot of selection of games to pick from for everybody. Some of the machines were not working properly though, but it didn't hinder us too much.\", 'The place itself was cool but the customer service was terrible. Our server was friendly but nowhere around when we needed her. \\nThe bartender also had a bad attitude, I questioned a double crown neat because it looked like an ounce and a half.. which is the standard for a shot. She grabbed the glass and went over to her jigger and measured it out but spilled some on the process. The second shot wasn\\'t full but she shot me a look like \"See?!\" so I wasn\\'t gunna piss her off more by telling her I saw it wasn\\'t full I saw her spill some in the process. I did ask if the jigger was only an ounce and she said yes. Super low house pour.. and the fact that the second wasn\\'t full basically meant I paid $15 for a standard shot. \\nThe other drink I ordered was flat.. I was flustered by her attitude and didn\\'t ask her to remake it. \\n\\nNot a good experience with the employees but we had fun playing games.', 'Wasnt very impressed by this place. I have been here a couple times to get a drink with my girlfriend and play those ticket games. This time i decided to have some food and sit at a table. The server only had 5 tables total to watch over and he was extremely slow. We ordered the nacho appetizer and some egg rolls. The nachos came out at a decent time but the rolls came out after we were about finished eating. We had to wait another 20 mins for the waiter to get back with our bill so we could leave. Not a very fun experience. I think i might just take my money and go to a local bar instead', \"My expectation for gameworks is that the games actually work. We opted for an hour unlimited play, which we understood that we wouldn't be getting tickets and about 12 machines that weren't valid with our pass. However, there were a large number of machines that were out of order. Especially a lot of the driving games with 2 player options had 1 player not working.  I feel like the maintenance of their machines used to be a lot better, or maybe the machines are just getting old and they are due for new ones. We still had fun with the ones that still worked, but I was pretty disappointed. They also have a bar here with reasonable prices along with a menu for food too.\", \"So I've been here before and it's ok. Does get pretty crowded. I came here on another occasion when it was slower. My BF and I were playing a game and a lady approached and set her child down on the game next to us. He started crawling over to get to our game.. He even picked up our balls and while playing this fast paced game I hit him with my elbow. Complete accident. I did not think this lady was partially challenged enough to allow her child to run wild. I told her to move her child or it'll happen again, he's not my responsibility. She threw back some shade, so I told her to learn to be a mother. Later my BF and I are at the bar and he is standing next to me. The lady came by as if she was about to exit. She took her styrofoam cup and threw her drink on my BF. I got up and threatened her damn life. We called management and he had said she is here almost everyday and let's her kid run around and he felt too bad to kick her out. Mind you, she isn't paying to play ANYTHING. End of story, he comped us some games and the bartender was cool enough to comp us a drink. Well, I'm here right now and she's still here doing the same thing. So if you're homeless or broke feel free to lurk around here and not spend money. Oh and bring all your kids so they feel bad and let you stay!\", 'Offered a yelp check for a free app with purchase of 2 entrees. Game Works would not honor this on fine and play combos.\\n\\nThis seems silly as the dine and play combos do cost more than the entrees. I understand not stacking \"promotions\" but game works is in the business of selling both food and games. We wanted to buy both of their offering. This doesn\\'t seem like a promotion as its any everyday offer.', \"I sat at the bar at around 10ish had the bartender Geovany absolutely terrible service. The moment we got to the bar the bartender didn't even acknowledge us we ordered two beers and a few items from the happy hour menu. \\n\\nThe food was great we got the sliders and the quesadillas. On the second round of drinks we ordered around 11:34PM the bartender took our order and didn't serve us until everyone else on the table was served. \\n\\nI keep going back to service but the only reason I'm even writing\", 'Fun and enjoyable. \\nBar, bowling, and games! \\nHad a blast price on drink is fair, but on games find it a little pricey but great place! \\nSweet girl bartender at bowling aisle and the gentlemen at the bowling area!', \"I had a blast! We got the groupon deal for $20 which included unlimited interactive game play and a $10 play card. So much fun! \\n\\nI hadn't been to a game works in years and I was pleasantly surprised with this location. Lots of fun games, clean, friendly service and open until midnight. Good times. Definitely will be back again.\", \"We have 3 teenagers ages 18, 14 & 12.  We wanted to check it out and take the kids to do something fun before school started back up. We are locals and this was our 1st time going to Town Square and to Gameworks.   Loved Town Square. .I will have to do another review on that. We entered Gameworks from the bar/restaurant side.  The bar area is pretty big.  On the opposite side of the bar is a huge area for dining.  In fact i think that area is too big.  They should probably reduce the dining area by half to make room for more games. The gaming area was not what i expected it to be.  I mean they had some cool games but i thought the area would be much larger.  The computer gaming room was pretty cool.  My son wanted to play but we didn't get a chance.  It was only $5 an hour to play on the computer. ..next time we go I'll let my kids play in there.  There was a bowling alley in a separate room...we didn't go check it out tho. We didn't eat there this time around so I don't know how the food is. They could do with getting a few more shooter games as those are the kind of games my kids like.  We spent $54 on a play card with 400 credits which was enough for the 3 kids.  Next time we will spend a little more.  Overall this place is pretty cool.  My kids had fun and wanted to stay longer. On the next visit my husband and i will get some food and drinks while the kids go play.\", \"What a great place to take kids for a couple of hours while in Vegas!  It was clean and well-managed and the service was exceptional. Rami took especially good care of us (one of my youngest was scared on the 3D ride and she stopped it, took him off and then restarted it for my other kids so they didn't miss a thing). And when a game didn't work, they took care of it right away. Even the toys you buy with tickets are better quality then most in places like this.\", \"Samantha Birsen was amazing getting my wedding reception all set up for me and our waitress was also amazing. Food was good. we had pizza it was really good we had thirty people. six pizzas was plenty of food along with party trays of cheese fruit and salad. Samantha went out of her way to make sure I had my wedding cake from a bakery and even picked it up for me. It couldn't of been a better day. Cheese was good fruit was good and games were fun. I'm not hard to please but was beyond amazed.\", \"What happened to GameWorks?  I understand they had to make changes after moving from the Strip.  But my expectations were so much higher.  You walk into the new location and it almost seems empty.  There is a lot of square footage, but not enough games to fill the space.  \\n\\nI am not a gamer.  But I do enjoy sports, driving, and flying games.  They had a bit of a selection, but it seemed like there could've been so much more.  \\n\\nMy experience here was okay, but I don't see myself coming back anytime soon.\\n\\nI hope as time goes on, GameWorks is able to get to something near what the Strip location was.\", 'WORST ARCADE IVE EVER BEEN TOO. WORST BARTENDER CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.

Of course, not having any kids of our own, we left them to their own fun and we set off on our own. \\n\\nThe place was busy, but not packed. My partner found his favorite game (some shooter game where you sit in a booth, and you're a pirate fighting undead pirates), and we initially started having a blast. Next, we found an old school Capcom Vs Marvel game that took our credits, and didn't let us play. My partner went to the check in desk and they refunded the credits. Cool. Then we went to a few other games, and most of those would do the same. I started paying attention and saw that it was happening to others, too. \\n\\nAfter getting frustrated, we found our friend and her son and played a bit with him (some of those kid games are even more fun than the arcade games). The ticket redemption area was a madhouse, as to be expected, but the staff was friendly enough. The trainer could have been more helpful with his trainee, but he was preoccupied with chatting with his coworkers, who found it appropriate to flip one another off in front of small children (but at least the coworker had enough tact to discreetly disguise it as pushing up his glasses). \\n\\nOh, and beers are $8 and up (I thought Town Square was a local's place, not the actual Strip), and the girl at the ticket counter said he average cost of a play was 4-9 credits. Sure. In the kid's area. The rest was at least 10 credits a play. One play. No multiple lives, or more than one shot in the kid's area.\", 'Wow, would not have expected the meal we had to come from here.

First off the cashier serving us--I had to repeat parts of the order a few times, he repeated some way wrong, then he repeated the whole thing and I heard burger in part of the order (wow this place was noisy, too), so I thought he finally got it right and I was tired of how long it took to order a burger for my son who\\'s very particular about what he gets (was ordering as a reward for being good), and get myself and my cousin a couple spicy chickens.\\n\\n2. The guy didn\\'t give us our soda cups, IT TOOK COMPLAINING TO ANOTHER PERSON TO GET SOMEONE TO GIVE US THE CUPS FOR THE SODAS WE BOUGHT!! (Thank you, miss!) And we weren\\'t the only customers he wasn\\'t giving cups to, might I add!\\n\\n3. We walked to the table to get out of the way and I looked everything over to make sure it was right...Spicy Mc Chicken instead of a burger.

Someone who was working here said its not necessary and she\\'d get what he ordered. (Another nice lady!)\\n\\n4. The cashier came to our table and started ARGUING WITH US, walked away and asked (a manager? I couldn\\'t see), then came back and said \"We\\'ll have to charge you to get what you wanted\", when all they had to do was replace the $1 Mc Chicken with a $1 burger with only ketchup on it.

There is absolutely no logic in that so after I ordered and tried to pay I was refused (even though I go thru the drive thru all the time!

But this restaurant is awful, despite the fact that they just remodeled.  I tried it a month ago because I wanted to try the 1/3 angus burger and see what that was all about.  The burger was \"okay\", but it was almost necessary to run a gauntlet to get it.  Right next to the front door, they had a full, full garbage can, and the stench was horrible - right next to the front door.  And then, I kid you not, I had to walk through a swarm of flies on my way to the front counter.  NOT appetizing.  I mentioned this to friends who said call the health dept., but I\\'m not going to do that to someone unless I see poisoned people in the aisles, let someone else do it if they want.  The reason I\\'m compelled to write is that I wanted to try another product (this is really close to my house), a chicken biscuit to compare to one I had in St. Louis to see if there were any decent biscuits here and McD\\'s advertises this all the time - the biscuit was overcooked and horrible and the chicken was burnt.  I wasn\\'t going in after the first experience, but I figured the drive through would be okay. The first window where they take the money was \"womanned\" by what seemed to be the manager, she was beyond rude.  The take out window girl was nicer, at least she smiled.

Again, sorry...', \"I dropped off a disabled neighbor at this McDonald's to get a cup of coffee and when I returned 20 minutes later, he was still waiting to receive his order.  When I complained that he should receive a refund because the wait was intolerable, the cashier refused to repay him and delivered a cold cup of undrinkable coffee.  When they treat a disabled senior this way, what does patronizing this place say about the rest of us?\", \"Dear McDonalds Corporate. The franchisee running this McD location needs to be recalled to Hamburger University and retrained on how to run their franchise properly. This location fails on so many things. Start by teaching the staff to listen to a customer's order. Follow up by teaching them the importance of order accuracy over sheer speed. Train the staff to give the customer options if something is not available. And last but certainly not least spend some money to make sure your basic equipment works correctly. For example if you're a McCafe location and every time someone rolls up to your drive thru and they can't order anything, you're really not a McCafe location at all. \\n\\nIn short most of the problems at this McDonalds can be traced back to MANAGEMENT FAILURE.

      "['I came here for a quiet place to eat lunch and work a year ago and now I come at least once a month. The Café is on the upper level overlooking Springs Preserve, and you can sit indoors or outdoors.  The new menu is tasty and affordable. I love the wedge salad w/ chicken, the hummus and the homemade potato chips.  They also have infused water with seasonal fruits, though they recently started charging $1.50 for it.\\n\\nGreat eats, great view and decent value', 'Def a restaurant with a beautiful view: Flatline view of the north end of the strip with the top view of the Stratosphere. It is an order your own food and then sit down kind place- so partial service restaurant. Surprisingly all the items that were recommended on Yelp from previous Yelpers were all not on the menu- tells me they possibly could change the menu quite often. BONUS: CHECK IN AND GET A FREE FOUNTAIN DRINK\\nHappy hour on Thursday 4-8pm: looks like a totally different menu than the regular menu\\nWe ordered for Brunch on a Sunday around 2PM\\n1) Chicken and Waffles- Chicken was super dry chicken breast and not served hot. The waffles were super chewy and eggo-waffle-ish (actually ego waffles tastes better) served with slices of orange and straberries- Not recommended\\n2) Buffalo Chicken Flatbread- 8 pieces of slightly chewy cheese with chopped buffalo chicken- not recommended\\n3) Cesar salad- Large portion super tasty and great crunch- served with a parmesan crisp (chicken or salmon can be added for 2-3$ extra)\\n4) Egg Frittata- Super tasty and not very eggy- super cheesy and yummy- served with a side of tatter tots (unusal but good tasting)- Very recommended\\n5) Bloody Marys- WEAKEST DRINK EVER- We dont even think there was alcohol in it- My friends kept saying it tastes just like tomato juice- spice blend was not present and seems like it comes out of a premade container\\n\\nOverall the food the was OK. I wish i could give it better stars- the thing that made this worth it was the view. \\nLastly one thing they need to learn how to control is the at least 5-8 pigeons that kept flying around the TV screens and above our heads. My friends kept screaming because the birds were flying so close to us. Also on Sundays please play the NFL games outside!!! Would be an extra bonus\\n\\nMay be back for the view and see the possibly changing menu.', 'Nice cafe for a snack or lunch.  Clean, organized and friendly staff.  We had 3 meat pizza large enough to serve 3 of us', 'Super yummy and fresh. We happened to show up once on accident for a Easter buffet that was all you can eat and my lord -it was super yummy!

To be honest, the location and the view get the 4 stars, the food probably warrants about 3.5.\\n\\nThe dining choices are good, and I've never had bad food or bad service, but there is nothing terribly special about the offerings. A solid burger, good wraps, good pizzas, some interesting specials. Again, the food takes second place to the location.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area, the views of the valley are great. Sit out on the balcony on a warm day an just take it all it.\", \"We had a great experience at the Mother's Day brunch. The staff was attentive and went the extra mile for us. Their attention to detail was apparent- they even had to-go style coffee cups. Food and atmosphere were great. We will be back.\", \"Another quality Happy Hour location in Vegas that I somehow came across. Only on Thursdays, from 4:00-8:00, they offer some great drink specials including $4 beers and $6 wines. The food isn't anything more than pub fare but it gets the job done. Live music and great views make for a nice evening. And the crowd was pretty small so you had the pick of the tables for sure. Definitely worth a trip on HH Thursdays. A nice change from your typical pub early evening out and a great way to begin Thirsty Thursday.\", \"We're pretty pleased w/ Divine Cafe.  We've been coming out for lunch fairly regularly after spending the day at Spring's Preserve with our toddler son.  Lately I've been hooked on their  Angus burger, its loaded w/ your choice of cheese, 2 thick slices of bacon along w/ lettuce & tomato.  Its pretty filling plus all their sandwiches come w/ french fries, sweet potato tots or chips.  My hubby likes their turkey wrap and my son loves their kid's cheese pizza, it comes out piping hot so be careful w/ your lil ones.  Our total this afternoon, w/ our 10% member discount came to ~$27 including 2 Honest Teas and a kids drink, which comes w/ the kid's meal.  For fast casual the food is pretty darn good and priced very reasonably.\", \"Great view, great food, great experience! \\n\\nI had the taco salad and I loved it! I didn't order anything to drink but they had flavored water (free) so I opted for that, that day it was strawberries :)\\n\\nWe sat outside and it was when it was still hot out but I actually still enjoyed it. The view makes you feel like you're not in the middle of the desert. You see parts of downtown Vegas and also have a view of the gardens below, so green :)\\n\\nI'll definitely be back!\", \"Most of us have gone to a theme park and been greatly disappointed by the food services.  Usually prepackaged, microwaved fare or fast food level, or super pricey)   Even the great San Diego Zoo has mediocre food for the most part (although if you search they do have some gems).  So I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the Springs Cafe which offers well prepared, gourmet style lunches and entrees at reasonable prices.  I had a ceviche salad that was excellent.  The hamburgers were great and the sides excellent.  The sundays were tasty.\\n\\nThis isn't a gourmet location though and the service is underwhelming, the ambiance mediocre. In fact the service was very poor, they tried to bring our deserts (we got free sundays with the coupon on the flyer) at the same time as the meal. Then when we got them to understand we wanted them to wait on delivery, they got mixed up as to how many we ordered.  Also the food takes a while.  But the food is worth it and even the picky eaters I was with enjoyed their meal without complaints, not an easy task.\", 'Had the chicken club wrap which was delicious. Service was top notch as usual - very attentive and anticipated my needs.', 'Food was excellent and well presented. I had a wrap which was very good. My husband had the burger. It was huge. My son had the Monte Cristo breakfast sandwich. It looked very good.  The prices were also reasonable.', \"Divine Cafe is the restaurant for those at the Springs Preserve in need of some food and beverage. It's pretty casual--you order at the counter, take a number, and wait for your meal to arrive at your table.\\n\\nThe menu was decent--a good mix of soups, sandwiches, pizza, etc. There is also a weekend brunch menu. My Mimi ordered the burger with fries and I the portobello burger with sweet potato tots. They were tasty and filling, especially since we were hungry from traipsing around the gardens and the Origen Museum, but nothing to gush over. \\n\\nThe space itself is very large and open. A major plus is that there is a balcony that overlooks the Preserve, so you receive an excellent view of both Downtown and the Strip. It was too chilly to sit out on the balcony, but the large windows sufficed. I did walk out to the balcony later to snap some pics, and yep, it's a great view.\\n\\nOverall, it's average food, but fortunately, not terribly expensive. I paid $25 (including tip) for both of our meals, which is not bad and fairly average with spending in Vegas anyway.\", \"First time here with the family, per suggestion of my father in law. Love the set up, open seating, order at the counter & have the food delivered to the table. Simple and basic selections, easy to read menu.\\n\\nI ordered the fish taco meal which came w/ 3 fish tacos folded in corn tortillas, topped with cabbage, a creamy sauce & cotija cheese. Very filling, but I think my mistake was I didn't get a side with it? They also provide drip coffee, hot tea, iced teas, & fusion water with the usual Coke soda fountain.

I cannot say enough about our wonderful Catering Coordinator, Cindy Yang. She was absolutely a dream to work with. Out of all the vendors I worked with, she was the ONLY one who was seamless all the way through. She responded ultra fast to all of my husbands dozens and dozens of emails. She arranged the most lovely tasting for us before the wedding and met with us numerous times at our request, always pleasant and smiling. After each time that we met up with her, we would stay and have lunch afterward. Every meal we ate at the cafe was soooooo yummy, making me feel very confident that the same level of detail would translate to our reception dinner.  \\n\\nMy whole life I have attended weddings with crappy food. Now, I totally get why people most likely skimp costs on food, being that I spent an arm and a leg on my own wedding meals...but one of the things I swore I would never do was have bad food at my wedding!!! It was high priority to me. \\n\\nWe ended up kicking off with a cocktail hour, including open bar and a fruit and cheese display outside on the balcony. I was not present for this (taking photos) but I heard it was wonderful!! The dinner for our guests started with Caesar salad, followed by a plated dinner with a double meat entree of steak and turkey (I LOVE turkey, hate chicken!) with garlic whipped potatoes and asparagus. Our vegetarians were delighted with the chef\\'s creation of a light, fresh orzo pasta in place of the meat (it was DELISH!!!!!) I have to say... our food was DIVINE!  EVERYONE complimented us on how delicious our food was and how it was the best wedding food they had ever had! This pleased me beyond measure! Also, knowing that my guests weren\\'t leaving and hitting up In and Out Burger after they left our wedding made me feel that it was all worth it! \\n\\nDiving Cafe had such a professional staff, and the head chef overseeing our dinner executed a perfect dinner. The cafe has such a spectacular view of the entire strip from the balcony and the the venue itself is so lovely. It fit perfectly with our \"desert\" themed wedding. \\n\\nOther things to note, they supplied the table linen and tableware. BONUS! \\n\\nThanks for everything DIVINE CAFE!

Enjoyed the Crispy Fish Tacos with French Fries, it was fresh and very good. Definitely plan on returning and taking a nice walk around Springs Preserve.', \"Excellent.  My husband and I shared a wood fired pizza special.  It was the BBQ chicken and normally I don't like BBQ Pizzas as they are normally drowned in BBQ sauce.  This was delicate, cooked perfectly and had amazing smokey flavor.  It honestly was just perfect.  The view from the deck overlooking LasVegas was the final touch.  I will be back in a few weeks for work and will becoming by here for a nice lunch.  \\n\\nI'm also an ice tea snob and it was also very well done.  Fresh and good quality tea, strength good and flavor able but not over done.\", \"Great customer service, beautiful and peaceful view, but most importantly delicious food.

Where else in Vegas do you have a view of this many trees and beautiful greenery?  Awesome outside dining area!  I would recommend sitting out there if the weather is cooperating.  Springs Preserve is where Vegas started! History of this place is very cool!... But you can learn more about that when you go there :).  \\n\\nFood is fresh and tasty, nice selection, kids menu and such great service!!  Everyone there was so incredibly friendly! The owner of the restaurant even came out and talk to us to make sure we were satisfied with everything.  I didn't catch her name, but it was so obvious that she and her team take such pride in what they do and in their food... awesome!  \\n\\nPersonally, I don't follow football, but I know they Broadcast games and have specials during the games.  \\nI think they host wedding receptions and parties as well - pretty enough for it!

I had what essentially was spaghetti with meatballs, and it was not that good.  The meatballs were super dense.  The sauce was too salty and greasy.  I think the pasta was whole wheat spaghetti, which i didn't mind, but I could see some people not liking the texture as compared to regular spaghetti.  My husband had a roast beef sandwich with french fries, which seemed ok.  The server brought the food without bringing any utensils, then went off for several minutes and served another table while we were sitting around waiting with food in front of us.  Kind of awkward.

I really expected bigger, but overall the taste quality wise was good. My wrap was delicious with a hint of spice and red peppers. + fries. We sat on the balcony & ate & it was a nice experience. I will be back. =)', 'Great fresh healthy food at great prices. The Fish Tacos rocked. Wonderful members benefit. Nice reprieve from the Desert environment outside.', 'I love this slice of paradise in the middle of the desert. It serves great, fresh food, along with a few beer choices. We ordered the Monte Cristo, Portallo mushroom panini with a side of broccoli cheddar soup, and the BBQ chicken salad. The spin on the Monte Cristo resembled a breakfast French toast with ham. Very good. The panini has a nice helping of provolone for the cheese lovers! That, with the mushroom and grilled zucchini and bell peppers... nom, nom, so good! Also, has outside seating overlooking the springs and a strip view.', \"You can't go wrong at the springs preserve. There is acres and acres for you to explore! Today we went to eat at the divine cafe, which is a cute little spot that sits above the preserve so you can see over it, if it's nice outside definitely sit outside. \\nThey have the farmers market on Thursdays but there wasn't too many booths this time, there was organic honey, vegetables and a plant with no soil basically like a patio plant very unique. \\nThis place is all about the kids!

Having come from 20yrs+ in Customer service including managing a restaurant business, this place hardly deserves even 1 star. I think an over haul is in order because this place needs some serious help!', \"The food here is tasty and well prepared, a relief with kids in tow.  Just not that many items on their menu.  I say this because I expect overpriced pre-packaged food from museum cafes.  However, it seems to be very well run with a manager who oversees the preparation of the food.  The menu is simple and the staff very friendly.  I love the view from this location of the preserves, as well as, the Strip, most specifically you can see the Stratosphere.  I forget I'm in Vegas!

Of course the prices will be inflated but they're not outrageous.\", 'Visit:  Weekend Brunch, Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015\\n\\nMy friend and I arrived at 10:00am -- I believe we were the first ones to arrive. The staff, including those that I could see working in the open kitchen all appeared to be happy and in wonderful moods. \\n\\nWe ordered The Burger (cooked medium) with French Fries and The Portabella Burger (vegetarian) with a Salad.  And because the morning was nothing short of perfection, we sat outside on the veranda -- the outdoor seating area is large, overlooks the preserve, and has a fabulous view of the city.\\n\\nThe Burger is fantastic. The bread is soft, toasted, and buttery. The bacon is thick and crispy. The meat is of quality and was cooked perfectly. \\n\\nFeedback: Serving the fries in a bucket is cute, but it causes them to be less crispy. Next time, I\\'d ask to have them served directly on the plate.\\n\\nThe Portabella Burger is fantastic as well. In place of a beef patty, the \"burger\" patty is actually a large portabella mushroom.  With the addition of marinated roasted peppers and hummus, this dish has a Mediterranean vibe about it. \\n\\nFeedback:  I would have liked a bit more hummus and the salad to have been a tad more substantial, it was a bit skimpy.\\n\\nI will return, again and again! \\n\\n---- \\n\\nMy Order....\\n\\nBURGER $9.50, + Cheddar\\nangus patty w/bacon, lettuce, tomato, cracked pepper mayo, brioche bun.\\n\\nPORTABELLA BURGER (vegetarian) $9.00, + $1.00 for salad\\ngrilled zucchini. roasted peppers. tomato. hummus. provolone cheese. brioche bun.\\n\\nINFUSED WATER  $1.50\\n\\nCOFFEE  $3.00', 'A great place to enjoy a bite to eat while visiting the Springs Preserve or just looking for a new hangout.

Fresh and high quality ingredients. Highly recommend trying this tucked away gem of a place. Did I mention the view of Las Vegas to go with your respite? Nice atmoshpere', \"Yelpers, you should bookmark this place.  The Divine Cafe only has one happy hour and it's on Thursdays from 4-8PM.  The restaurant is separate from the Preserve so you don't need a museum or parking ticket.  \\n\\nThe cafe/venue itself deserves 5 stars all on its own because it is very large and can accommodate large parties, families, or intimate dates inside OR outside.  Outdoor seating would be my preference because it provides a panoramic view of Las Vegas.  You can see downtown as well as the Strip.  However, the indoors gives off a rustic vibe with doors and windows that still have access to that beautiful view.  There's also live music inside which, in my opinion, is uncommon in this city.  For all those reasons, this place is worth a visit.\\n\\nTheir happy hour menu is very limited, but has just enough variety.  They have their own cocktail drinks, a nice selection of bottled beers, and wine.  I was most impressed by the food portions.  We ordered nachos, calamari, and the date flatbread.  I thought they would be tapas style, and boy was I wrong.  The portions were very generous, and for the price, they're almost a steal considering the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Food was great, but my favorite was the bacon and date flatbread.\\n\\nGive this place a go... I doubt it will disappoint.\", \"I haven't been here in a couple years since it was Wolfgang Puck's restaurant and even though it was good, it was pricey for what I wanted. I noticed this time around, it changed names and it took some convincing from my hungry boyfriend to just eat here while on our Springs Preserve date than venture off campus. That being said:\\n\\nWe ordered the chicken pesto pizza $10 and a burger (boyfriend never mentioned the name) $9-10 ordered medium rare. The views are beautiful and so relaxing with their floor to ceiling windows overlooking Springs Preserve and the Vegas skyline from the northwestern perspective. Food didn't take long and they brought it to the table. My pizza was definitely not just a personal size. It's good enough for two super hungry people or three people snacking. DELICIOUS. The oils from the cheese were everywhere and when you pull the slice, it had that glorious stretch of soft fresh cheese...the way pizza was meant to be. Johnny's burger was pretty good, better than I would expect. It looked like a gourmet burger with a half pound or so patty cooked medium rare with its juices still intact on a brioche bun. All the condiments you need are already on the table including hot sauces. Oh, and the fountain drinks include a dispenser of water infused with mint and sliced strawberries. With  a squeeze of lemon, it was amazingly refreshing and tasteful for the hot summer day.\\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised. Definitely had the midrange cafe prices but service, food, and quality was there. Good stuff.\", \"Had the vegan burger, the patty fell apart, and that happens sometimes with veggie patties, but it also lacked flavor.  The fat fries were good but not exceptional.The husband had the margarita pizza it was nice and thin but also lacked seasoning. Next time I'll try something else, I'm not willing to give up on this place yet.\", 'A true gem of a cafe. I\\'ve visited DC only twice and both times have been incredible. The staff is warm and genuine. The food quality is exceptional for \"fast casual\" and adequately priced. The view of the Strip is perfect; far away! I would eat here every day if it was closer to my home.', 'Divine Cafe is connected to the Spring Preserves, but there is no need to be a member to dine here. If you are a member you get 10% off of your meal and membership is worth it IMHO. After having a delightful lunch you can explore all the Spring Preserves has to offer!\\n\\nI almost always eat outside, where you have a fantastic view of the Strip. This last visit I shared the Cuban Sandwich with sweet potato tots  and  Pizza Blanca with my boyfriend. The pizza was terrific!  And my new favorite sides are the sweet potato tots. \\n\\nThe outdoor seating area does have heaters when it is chilly. Happy hour is on Thursdays 4pm to 8pm. They sometimes have classes on how to cook too.', \"We love this café! It's our second time here in less than 2 weeks. The atmosphere is perfect and the view over the preserve gorgeous!\\nYou must try the chicken press parmigiana sandwich soo good!\", 'Came here for lunch during my residency interview. Has a gorgeous outdoor deck area to view the surrounding landscape. \\n\\nThe food is great and the restaurant is bright, spacious, and open. A very pleasant dining experience overall, and great friendly service too!', \"Good food, great service, fantastic view at a just-right price. We'll go back again.\", 'LOVE the Springs Preserve and have always enjoyed the food, but today was BAAADDD! \\n\\nI took friends from out of town. Wanted them to have a locals, \"non-Vegas\" experience. They loved the place.  We all ordered the \"breakfast taco\" from the Sunday brunch menu. Turned out to be 3 little tacos which would\\'ve been fine, but they were COLD. The little corn tortillas were tough and chewy. There was almost no egg, but there was a long strip of bacon (cold) in each one, hanging out the ends. Terrible presentation. There was something that we decided was cheese melted onto the little tortilla. It had a slice of avocado and supposedly sour cream. The whole thing was very skimpy. I was embarrassed. My friends kept assuring me it was fine, but it was not. \\n\\nI have been to the SP many times and have always loved taking people there. I will think twice, though, about doing it again.\\n\\nI would like someone from the Divine Cafe to reply to this and let us know what happened. Was the chef not working this day? Was this a new offering for you and you didn\\'t really have it together? What? Please tell us this was a one-time goof-up and not what you will be serving  for other Sunday brunches.', 'Revised review... \\nSo sad to write this, as this has been our place for so long. I\\'m not sure what\\'s going on at the restaurant there but things have definitely changed. The past few times we\\'ve been there it\\'s taking an extremely long time to get our food. And we\\'re not talking peak times we\\'re talking just on a regular day where there aren\\'t that many people and there\\'s a 20-plus minute wait just to get a couple of entrees. This last time we went kind of did it for me. I got the fish tacos after waiting a really long time again, we ate... it wasn\\'t til the last taco that I realized there was a thick black piece of hair in there. I brought it to the servers attention... they all stood there talked about it looked at it didn\\'t say a word to me so we just left. As much as I love this place I don\\'t really want to go back after that. They don\\'t seem to care and that was just damn nasty. We eat out a lot and this was one of our regular spots. I\\'m kind of bummed.\\n\\nOld review...\\nLove this place. One of our secret \"locals\" spots. It\\'s a cafe set up so nothing fancy but clean and comfy. The food is actually pretty damn good. Better than average lunch places. Prices are about what you\\'d pay for a meal deal at some nasty fast food place $8 to $9. Big portions and pretty presentation. Fountian drinks and some infused waters and different flavored teas available for refreshments.\\nIt\\'s a little hot during the summer but view is awesome. You can see the whole valley from the balcony. Highly recommend for businesses lunches or a quick meal out. Wish they were open longer but think they close at 3pm. Would be cool if they served dinner.', \"This is one of the best places in Las Vegas that probably not too many people know about. I've been a member of the Spring Preserve for over 4 years and have had many experiences here from the museums to the numerous events held here. My family is here whenever we get a chance. The café has good food and happy hour on Thursday (this is a good excuse to spend an evening at the Preserve minus the kids). You also get a panoramic view of downtown and the strip from the café's balcony\", 'came for the easter brunch - my kids loved the food and the accommodating staff.   will try their happy hour next!', \"We've been visiting the park for almost a year but it is our 1st time here. I'm between 4 and 5 star rating and heres my review:\\n\\nFood - we ordered Chicken Milanese, Teriyaki Salmon bowl & rootbeer float with oreo churros - generous portions and were all yummy. They have fruit infused water for all which was great. We're looking forward to trying other items on the menu. Its good to have options beyond the usual burger and hotdog when you are at a park/museum.\\n\\nPrice - reasonable though everything is $10+. Reasonable becoz portions are generous and bcoz prices at themeparks and the like are usually pricier. \\n\\nAmbiance - dine inside or outside. The patio has good view of the mountains and of the Las Vegas hotel bldgs. The patio provides enough shade. We dined in September so it was comfortable outside I just dont know how it is in the middle of hot hot Vegas summer =) The whole place is generally clean and well kept.\\n\\nService - there seems to be adequate staff... but the food was served longer than expected. But we didn't really mind as we were enjoying the birds while we sat at the patio. All staff from the cashier to the server and table guy we're all very friendly.\\n\\n\\nWe will definitely be back to try out other items from their menu and dine at their patio =)\", \"Gorgeous location at the Springs Preserve with views of the strip and valley!\\n\\nThis place is so pretty and it has so many details that I love from the decor, fresh flowers to the lighting. \\n\\nWhy the 2 stars? \\n\\nThe food here is just awful. I've been here multiple times and I remember the good ol' days when Wolfgang Puck was running the show. Here are my thoughts -\\n\\nThe teriyaki chicken bowl serves up precooked chicken and frozen veggies on mushy rice with a very heavy bottled teriyaki sauce. Skip it.\\n\\nThe turkey wrap comes with wet meat. Yep, wet in just a wrong way. It's also cut into 3 pieces without any tucked end so when you take a bite everything falls out of it. The fries aren't fresh.  Skip it.\\n\\nThe pizza is ok. The crust is too thick & chewy for my liking but it's way better than the other items mentioned above. \\n\\nThe salads are probably the better options here as well but the meat is still precooked. \\n\\nThe chicken Milanese is dry and the chicken is sad as it's just been reheated most likely in a microwave. \\n\\nThis review in general just makes me sad. I love the location and space but the food just tastes awful. I hope somebody brings a new seasonal menu to this location and stops serving precooked meat. Also, the prices are far too high for this kind of quality.\", 'Excellent food, higher price but well worth it! Service was good as well. The outside patio also makes for a great environment for a little lunch date!', \"Very beautiful atmosphere with fantastic views!! went for the weekend brunch which was really tasty. I had one of the breakfast sandwiches that had a nice jam spread and a prickly pear mimosa. I can't wait to return for sure to try more things off of their menu.\", 'Great spot for lunch. \\nNice view of the strip. \\nYou order your food, they give you and number, pick your seat and wait.  \\nFriendly staff. \\nI had the turkey melt with avocado-very good.  \\nOutdoor seating is available.', 'We stopped by after the annual fall plant sale as we were having a food crash. I was not expecting much...boy what an incredible treat this place is. \\nI ordered the burger and my husband got the chilaquiles off the brunch menu. We enjoyed our meal so much we stopped by again on Monday since we were in the area. This time we split a burger and a wedge...the wedge was beyond delicious and HUGE ! They nailed it, hard boiled egg sprinkles all over, small cherry tomato halves and sliced cucumber with drizzles of dressing, some kind of amazing goodness. We split a small cup of tomato bisque, so delicious.\\nThis is our new go-to spot ! We love Springs Preserve and adore Divine Cafe...', 'The food was good but the service and professionalism was over the top. I and my 5 year old son and 11 year old daughter stopped by here for lunch after a fun experience at the museum and preserve. I ordered the tuna tataki, my son got the kids pizza, and my daughter got the kids mac and cheese.  \\n\\nWe were served after about 6 or so minutes but they did not bring out the kids pizza. Apparently what had happened was the cashier did not ring it up. I was prepared to go pay for it but they refused and comped it. Not only that they brought my son a plate of chips to snack on as he had to wait 5 minutes for his food while we had ours already. I thought that was pretty classy. AND THEN...they came out and gave us a complimentary desert of warm chocolate chip cookies with chocolate syrup. \\n\\nI was very impressed. My tuna tataki salad was very good...great views...and stellar service.', \"The wife turned me on to this place when we were searching for something local to do over the weekend and I was greatly impressed! We ended up spending the entire day at Springs Preserve because it is such a large place and there are quite a few exhibits to see, trails to walk/ride, and plenty of places to practice photography.\\n\\nSince we're locals, we only paid $20 to get in ($10/ea.) and, at the end of the day, they allowed us to turn that $20 into a $45, two-person annual pass!\\n\\nI took over 500 pictures that day and only spent time in about 60% of Springs Preserve.\\n\\nCheck out my photos here: http://www.panoramio.com/user/8631485/tags/Springs%20Preserve. That will give you an idea of what you'll see and what you can do.\\n\\nThe Divine Cafe is a great place to take a break, relax, and eat some great food. They also serve wine to go along with your pizza or other food offerings.\\n\\nWe don't have kids, but there were quite a few playing around in the kids playground and we were able to see the butterfly exhibit which was awesome!\", \"Excellent food. Nothing like you would expect. We ordered the happy hour appetizers Chocolate filled beignets and the Bacon and Deviled eggs. Not only was I surprised about the presentation but the food was excellent and very flavorfully creative!!! I say give this place a try. You'll be just as surprised as I was. The only thing I would say is that the food takes quite a while to get to your table.\", \"Great Thursday evening happy hour, with live music.  Tonight, chilled to island style mellow tunes with bruddah Ryan and Iz, members of popular Vegas group, Haleamano.  Check out the drink specials and tasty pupus like the Buffalo wings with tangy Bleu cheese dip, hot cheesy spinach artichoke dip with toasted baguette slices, duck and sweet & spicy bacon  sliders, and creative street tacos.  Can't beat the view of the strip from the balcony.  Trult nice spot for couples and families.\", \"ABSOLETELY love the food here. Haven't ordered something we haven't liked. If I could give more stars I would. Service is absolutely excellent. Today I happened to leave my credit card without realizing. To my surprise, as I was leaving the parking lot our server was waiting for us. She flagged me down and returned my card to me. To me this is going above and beyond! I only wish I knew her name, but a big thank you for being so awesome! It isn't everyday someone would do that. Thank you to the whole staff for providing great good and service!\", 'Super overpriced, but a great view. Came here for my birthday for lunch prior to taking a walk around the preserve. A majority of the tables were reserved for those doing the buffet so we had to walk around looking for a table that was available. The buffet was super overpriced for what they offered. The pricing was just slightly less than eating at Bacchanal at Ceasars, yet not even offering a quarter of Bacchanal. Needless to say, we opted for the regular menu which was also pricey. My husband ordered a pizza and the dough was way under cooked and doughy. I ordered the chicken teriyaki plate which was not good. The chicken had a heavy soy sauce taste and lots of tough pieces. Only giving it a 2 star because of the view.', 'Having seen brochures for the Springs Preserve since long before we moved to Vegas, I thought it was an over-hyped \"pseudo-outdoor\" attraction. And while there is a bit of that (pseudo-rock formations), I am sorry that we waited 3 years into our residency to get here. It\\'s a really educational and beautiful place. \\nBut the most pleasant surprise was the Divine Cafe. Located on the 2nd floor of the same building that houses the gift shop [and the \"nature exchange\"...an awesome idea], the cafe has a small but tasty menu. We were expecting the stale hot dogs and bagged popcorn that most zoos or amusement parks offer; instead we lucked into a new \"favorite\" lunch/brunch spot! This is real Vegas quality food...and we are talking from the perspective of a couple of spoiled Vegas foodies! The burgers are high quality, the shoestring fries are \\'divine\\', the charcuterie plate (while not quite up to the standards of the Andiamo version that I adore) had an assortment of yummy bites at a very decent price. We can\\'t wait to go back and try their brunch and pizza selections!\\nAnd like every place in Vegas, the cafe serves a nice selection of adult beverages...again, at a very reasonable price, esp. relative to Strip prices.\\nIf your guests are bored with the Strip...or if they have KIDS, take them to the Springs Preserve. We will be doing that...and we won\\'t make a trip to the preserve without having lunch or brunch at Divine Cafe. Not only is it GOOD food at good prices; but oh, the VIEW of the Strip from the patio. Just go and enjoy some fresh air with great scenery, a nosh...and relax!', \"A Monte Cristo is by God a sandwich AND it is listed under the sandwich menu, so why the hell does it not come with the listed sides? The world may never know, as it pissed me off so much that we left.  I've had good food and enjoyed the good view  before, alas not today.\", \"One of the best museum Cafes around! My family and I really enjoy having lunch here after our regular visit to the Springs Preserve grounds & museums. I think they offer a nice variety of great food at fair prices. So far, I really haven't had anything Ive disliked. Have tried the burger, wedge salad with chicken, Cuban sandwich, chicken sandwich & Hawaiian teriyaki bowl. All good, fresh food & good portions. I have brought a few friends here who hadn't eaten at the cafe before & they were all pleasantly surprised. When the weather gets nice outside (spring & fall), we really like sitting outside & having lunch while enjoying the amazing views. Highly recommend checking it out.\", \"Let's start surg the view and exceptional service. Now my favorite the FOOD is fresh, delicious I love this place\", \"I came here for lunch with five other friends. I wanted to try the bento box because, I love bento boxes and I've heard some buzz about them. But after eating some of mine, and seeing what my friends were eating, I really regretted it.\\n\\nEverything was greasy, even the rice. I scooped my rice to the side of the box to strain some of the grease. Yes, it was that bad. I couldn't finish it.\\n\\nMy friends had the salad bar, a cobb salad, vegan burger and flat bread sandwich (5th friend also had a bento box). The Springs Cafe is all about healthy eating and natural foods so I should have ordered something of that standard.\\n\\nI want to go back because my dining companion's lunches looked SOOO good, but I definitely will NEVER order another bento box.\\n\\nThere are waiters, but the service is similar to a buffet restaurant where you pay for what you want first, get your beverage cup and seat yourself. There server who delivered our food and checked on us a couple of times was very nice and professional.\", \"Had the brisket and also the vegan sandwiches. One with side salad and the other with fries. Both entrées were really good and the side salad with house dressing was surprisingly good. Also ordered the kids mac and cheese and appreciated how they had fruit and vegetables as sides. I'd get the vegan burger again. \\n\\nWe received a membership discount so we were pleasantly surprised by our bill! I didn't give 5 stars because I would like to try another item on menu the next time we are here.\", \"I've been up here about 5 times now and the latest was when Springs Preserve held their Space exhibit.  What's not to love about this place.  The food quality has always been good, you can sit outside for a good view of Springs Preserve with your meal and their menu is simple.  \\n\\nDon't come here if you're looking for a fancy place with a good view.  The menu literally consists of only salads, burgers, sandwiches, and pizzas.  Oh they do serve alcohol though!  \\n\\nThe last thing I got here were the lobster rolls which was yummy.\", \"We were pleasantly surprised with the food here.  I had the tasty chicken BLT and my husband had the Cuban sandwich, which was savory.  The bread on the Cuban was a bit dry but the overall taste made up for it. We also ordered the kids chicken fingers combo, which came with fruit, carrots/celery, tater tots and gold fish crackers.. One of the healthier kids combos we've seen in a while. Our kid loved it.  I had a glass of their Chardonnay, which was fruity and crisp. My husband had their Lager on draft..

My son ordered a quesadilla as usual and actually ate the whole thing- which he never does! It looked really good and came with a fruit skewer. I had the Mexican bento box. The meat was delicious but everything else was eh. I liked it enough to come back. Great food for kids I think.', 'First time visitor this past Sunday.  I took my sister and mother here for their Mother\\'s Day brunch.  Layout of the food was confusing.  Why would you put bacon with cold fruit and not with the hash browns and sausage?  Why would you not put a pan of scrambled eggs out?  Why would I have to stand in the omelet line for scrambled eggs?  Why does it take two \"chefs\" with 4-6 pans going at the same time over 7-10 minutes to make an omelet?  Why was I ignored after standing in line for an omelet?  Very disappointed, but willing to give this place another shot...but not anytime soon.', 'Great menu, delicious food and an amazing view of the city. Definitely an unexpected treat at a museum and botanical garden. Great kids menu too.', \"My friend and I were recently at the Springs Preserve for the Vegas Gone Yoga festival and we decided to check out this cafe while on a lunch break. I liked that they had a variety of different vegetarian friendly options and the outdoor seating area was beautiful. When you walk in you place your order at the counter and they bring it out once it's ready.\\n\\nFor food I decided to go with the garden sliders and a side salad. The sliders were not really a veggie patty, but more of a veggie mush. I wish they would have been more patty like, but overall the flavor was still good. (3.5/5) The salad was also a nice touch, very fresh.\\n\\nThis is definitely a nice option for a lunch break at the park with some beautiful scenery.\", 'Nice friendly staff. Amazing view. And the food was great.  Clean place. Will for sure be back. Thank you all', 'I have been to the cafe and the waiters were rude and the table where dirty food over priced and not that good. But I also have been out to a cpl of event in the last 4 months and they were the caterer for the events. At each event the food was horrible cold. My friend had hair in her food. The staff were rude. The tables the food was on was dusty. I am quite shocked these ppl get hired for events. Its awful. I would never use them for my event. I am sured to have pissed guest. Noone liked the food at the events. Atleats there was a bar thank god. BUT A BIG THIMBS DOWN for food and service. If you are having an event DONOT hire these ppl. What they think is upscale is not. Uggghhhh', \"We are members of the springs preserve and eat at this cafe all the time. Monday we went to the cafe  with our homeschool group. It was 4 moms and our kids. All of us  ordered food for us and our kids. 3 of the 11 kids we had with us have special dietary needs. Some are vegetarians and other have gluten and nut issues. When we came in and sat Down a man approached us and welcomed us. I informed him that we would all be ordering food but asked would it be ok if the 3 kids with food issues ate what their mothers brought for them. He said that was not a problem. So we all proceeded to order food for the rest of us. Which was 12 of us not including the 3 eating Their own food. As we were finishing ordering this very rude women started pointing at us and talking to the other workers. I said excuse me is there a problem? She said yes there was that those kids can't eat their lunch in here. I explained that they had food issues and the rest of us had purchased food. She rolled her eyes and said food allergies really? I was so embarrassed and uncomfortable. She said that the owner would never let that happen and that if she came in she would ask is all to leave. I have never felt so unwanted at a restaurant in my life. The owner would ask a group of moms and their kids to leave a restaurant because 3 kids have food issues that they can't help? I find that extremely hard to believe! We go to other restaurants that don't have an issues with this. This is the first place to ever give us a hard time. After we all got our food and were starting to eat she was still pointing at us while were eating and talking to another worker. It was so awful. We could not wait to get out of there. We come to the springs on a regular basis with our school group and we will never be back to this restaurant. We will do our lessons and go somewhere else to eat. Which is really very unfortunate.\", \"I went to this place yesterday and was served a buffalo chicken and blue cheese salad. My husband got a bbq brisket sandwich on a pretzel bun with fries. Or food was good, but it wasn't too hot temperature wise. Additionally the brisket sandwich was sliced brisket, so it didn't really blend with the sauce well. Because of this, my husband didn't really easy much of it. We enjoyed the food though, the service was fast and polite. We will definitely be back.\", \"Had the lunch here during the Asian Heritage Celebration. The food is actually quite good, but we waited more than 30 mins for two orders of food because our order receipt wasn't printed out so they skipped ours. When we expressed our concern to the manager, she just didn't seem to care about our problem, and she actually did not know what's the big deal and just pushed us away. Very BAD dining experience and won't recommende to my friends at all.\", 'Every year I have a tradition of hiking the trails of the Springs Preserve when ghosts, goblins, wicked pumpkins, and other haunted creatures adorn the park. I never got to experience the nightime Haunted Harvest. Knowing that I was going to be in the park all day, I decided to have lunch in the park\\'s Divine Cafe. \\n\\n   My expectations of theme park /cultural center food is convenience over quality. However, Divine Cafe exceeded my expectations. It wasn\\'t really a shock because I had been there before to enjoy a beverage. The restaurant did have a positive vibe. Heidi Knapp Rinella in her September 25, 2014 Review Journal article \"Springs Preserve\\'s Divine Cafe True to its Name\" says it best:\\n\\n       \"The Springs Preserve doesn\\'t have to have\\n        a cafe. But, like the preserve, it sure makes\\n        life a lot nicer.\"\\n\\n  As soon as you exit the elevator or climb the steps above the gift shop, you enter a divine space. Your eyes immediately overlook the counter and football field of tables, chairs, and even sofas toward the glass walls with one of the most divine views in Las Vegas. This is a divine vista including a panorama of the Downtown Las Vegas skyline with the Stratosphere and Las Vegas Strip skyline framing the open spaces of dessert and wetlands. When it comes to eating with a view, Divine Cafe is a jackpot. The two places to enjoy the view are from inside and the patio. The inside is like a glass house where many tables are front row.\\n\\n  Ordering is relatively easy. There are menus outside and at the entrance. I ordered the burger with fries and a fountain beverage. After a Yelp check-in offer for a free beverage with an entree it came to less than $11. The burger was made of the finest ingredients. This was a thick burger with tomatoes, bacon, mayo, and provolone cheese. The fries were plentiful and flavorful. The bottomless cola was refreshing. The condiments on the table made dining a better experience. \\n\\n  I was impressed with the service. Immediately the friendly lady greeted me when I walked inside. When I asked if the burger included cheese, she mentioned the four choices the menu omitted. She happily accepted my Yelp check in offer. Minutes after I put my number on the table, a friendly man brought my food to the table. He also cleaned up the plate. Another aspect of good customer service is confidence that no funny stuff is going on with my food. Divine Cafe has an open kitchen where I could see my food being made. Likewise, I know that it is being freshly made. On another note, Divine Cafe is especially clean. To my olfactory scent, the bathroom smelled more like the scented air in the Aria than a public restroom.\\n\\n   Just like Springs Preserves, Divine Cafe provides a terrific experience at a great price. I was very impressed. Hopefully one day I could make their Thursday Happy Hour and take in the sun going down over the panoramic vista of Downtown and the Las Vegas Strip. Or maybe I\\'ll return for their new weekend brunch. Until then, I will reward Divine Cafe with a review of four stars that says \"I\\'m impressed! \"', \"Nice dining area al fresco.  Birds singing and great overview of park and city. Children's meal was perfect portion sized.  Vegan wrap and fries were tasty and delicious.  Friendly and accommodating staff.\", 'Lots of parking, but may be crowded on some days.  No need to pay the park entrance fee to eat at the cafe.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Wonderful view of the city and the park.  Inside and outside dining.  The food is pretty good.  Employees are friendly.  The manager dropped by to check on things and say hello.  Prices are a little high, but not bad.  Daily specials are served in a bento box.  The menu is designed with sustainability in mind.  Busy lunch crowd.  My favorite part of this experience is the atmosphere.', 'The Springs Cafe has amazing food for a great price. My family and I go here all the time and love it. Also, it has a really nice patio area with great views of the Las Vegas strip.', \"We really enjoyed our lunch here. I'm between four and 5 stars. Its located in the springs preserve. On the second story with a lovely view of the strip. Tons of greenery around us. Their is an indoor and outdoor section (with heaters for the winter, and it's covered for summer shade).\\n\\nDuring happy hour Thursday's 4-8pm it's 5 stars. Right now probably 4 stars because the coffee tasted pretty trashy, and expensive for lacking in flavor brew ($3).\\n  \\nThe food is surprisingly good. We had the pizza Blanca ($9.5): it had truffle oil, arugula, white sauce and mushrooms. Nice crust, good flavor. They have several decent craft brews available. We had a Samuel adams ($5-6)\", \"I was quite impressed with the cafe. I always assume food vendors and restaurants inside of museums or government buildings are more of a convenience than an actual attraction however the Divine Cafe has me waiting for next weekend to return. \\n\\nI love Veggie Benedict's so I gave theirs a try and to my surprise the ingredients were fresh and the presentation was impressive. The views of the valley are also worth trying the Cafe. \\n\\nI would have given them a 5 star review but the only reason I couldn't was because they cooked the spinach on the Veggie Benny instead of using fresh spinach leaves. This is more of a preference of mine vs an actual knock on the cafe. The rest of the menu was diverse and had many great, light summer type meals. \\n\\nI believe the menu was well thought out since most customers will be continuing their exploration of the park therefore need a light meal to avoid feeling sluggish. I enjoyde the cafe very much and can't wait to go back.\", 'Great cafe with decent food, low prices, great environment, short lines, and plenty of seats.  This is a popular cafe for business luncheons especially with free wifi.\\n\\nThe burger ($9.50) is a solid meal with a side (options: tater tots, fries, soup, or salad).', \"Diverse menu, beautiful view, exceptionally fresh, quality food, friendly and knowledgable staff, spacious seating (indoors and out), kid friendly, healthy choices, and convenient for those visiting the park (you can also drive up and enter the cafe separately). I had a burger and was pleased that they offered to cook it to medium. It came out perfectly and was a huge portion. (Something I can't say I've felt at similar places.) Homemade chips were great. Fruit water was refreshing and welcome after a warm day. My son got a kid burger and I was really impressed at the variety and amount of food he received as well - veggies, fruit, crackers, tots, and a mini burger with drink included. Members get 10% off.\", 'A snacking jewel in the Preserve.\\n\\nDecent food and a surprisingly gorgeous view of the Strip is the main draw of the Divine Springs Cafe. I came here on Thursday for the Happy Hour special which is from 4pm to 8pm and offers bar food and a decent selection of beers. \\n\\nI went with the tater tots, that were free with a donated toy to \"Toys for Tots\", and the Chicken Nachos. I also sampled the house chips that we\\'re placed on the table as soon as  sat down. This place is by no means a hot bed of foodie activity, but a more a refueling station after exploing the preserve.  \\n\\nThe food is on par with most bar bites, nothing was terrible, but it also wasn\\'t mindblowing, it was just good. The Nachos are a huge portion and definitely shareable and the house chips were nice salty snack before we were inundated with salty carby treats. \\n\\nThey only offer Happy Hour on Thursdays and the menu is pretty limited, but it\\'s perfect food for socializing and catching up with the homies. I would recommend coming here during the day, this way you\\'ll have a chance to snack on their full menu. \\n\\nLearn stuff and eat. It\\'s the American way!', 'The view from the outside seating is beautiful. The hummus is delicious. They accommodated my allergy and gave me cucumbers with my hummus. The salad was amazing! My friend had their soup and it was fresh and delicious. We both really enjoyed eating at the Spring Preserve.', \"Let me just start this off with saying DIDNT EXPECT to spend the whole day here and indulge in happy hour, invite a friend out and listen to some tunes whilst enjoying the amazing view of the sun setting. I just wanted to check out the SP as I have not been before. My experience was five stars all the way, we will be making Thursday's a regular thing at Devine. Amazing service, can't beat the HH prices, food was delicious and the view is like the icing on the cake. Do yourself a favor and come here for brunch, lunch happy hour or good old fashioned dinner whatever fits into your schedule the vibe will sell itself. \\n\\n\\nP.S. Thursday's Happy Hour 4-8pm usually with live music just saying (:\", \"I love taking the kids and our visitors to the Springs regularly.  It's one of LV hidden treasures.  Having Divine Cafe makes it even better.  Don't have to make an extra stop or eat junk food prior to our day. A great family outing. We always lunch at the Divine Cafe before we start. The food is exceptional and always fresh and hot.  The kids love how their food is served. I will leave this surprise for ur visit.  We made reservations for Mothers Day and was not disappointed. Omelets, pasta and sides were fresh and hot. I like my food very hot or crisp and cold!!! The steak was perfectly seasoned and tender. we tried several drinks that were consistently mixed the second time around!  The bacon was in a odd area but no crowd getting to it. The size of the desserts r perfect!  No waste for a perfect taste! The price is very reasonable for the Brunch with a view to Make a perfect beginning or ending of ur day.  We look forward to another Brunch!\", \"Came into this place, we were told we could sit anywhere. Decided to sit outside and enjoy the view and weather. Boy was that a mistake! \\n\\nWe were almost completely ignored by the wait staff. We attempted multiple times to get their attention to attempt to get served. Every time we were told some body would be by, nobody showed up after. \\n\\nMany other people sat down after us and they were visited by the wait staff and got their drinks. We weren't even brought water. After an hour of being ignored we decided to leave.\", 'Wonderful stunning views of las Vegas from the deck! Kinda like a central park. They have basic American stuff like salads pizza and burgers. Its not cheap. But they have free chips and salsa at the corner end which is a plus.', \"New name and menu and improved food.  Checked our the restaurant at the Springs Preserve for the first time since the latest update.  I've eaten at the cafe 5-7 times over the years including when it was Wolfgang Puck and after as well.  I think this update is an improvement in both price and taste. We had 3 entrees and 3 kids meals for $44. My kids are 3,5,6 and the kids meals were a good amount of food for them asks included fresh fruit / veggies. The kids mac n cheese is yummy and the snack tray was perfect for my 3year old. The lobster sandwich special was awesome with the tomato bisque soup especially for $10. The service was more attentive than in the past although I've never had an issue on previous visits they just seemed a little more helpful this time. In the past the foods quality was hit or miss and a little overpriced. As a member that meant we normally skipped the café.  With this update we will definitely stop more often on our visits.\", 'I think we like coming here better than the park!  Awesome food and reasonable prices.  Great view of the strip too.  Burgers, pizza, salads - they are all wonderful.  Everything is fresh and made to order.  After a hot day at the park, the soda fountain is to die for.\\n\\nYou dont even need to get into the park to eat there!  ;)', 'Great view, great food, great prices and close to downtown where I live. Will come back and recommend it to friends.', 'The springs cafe has changed. New name and new menu. A meal per person on average will cost $10. I ordered a hamburger and it fell apart. I ordered the kids mac and cheese for my 8 year old and the Mac and cheese on the plate was about 2 tablespoons worth of Mac and cheese. This place is not the same. The exquisite food by the culinary school is gone. Unlikely I will be returning. This is a big disappointment since I have a pass and come here often with my family. I will be eating outside of springs preserve now.', \"For ambiance, price, selection, and quality of food, this cafe does as well as anyone.  They even offer discounts to SP members.  We recently had a group brunch on a Saturday and this turned out to be a perfect venue.  It's not crowded at that time (surprisingly), so we were able to stay a long time without feeling we were taking up space from other customers.  \\n\\nThe brunch food was really good and really well priced.  Seriously, I think for brunch there are only one or two things on the menu that are over $10.  You can't say that about even the junky pancake houses.  Plus if the weather is good you can eat outside, away from traffic, and with a view of the preserve.  It's also mostly shaded outside.  \\n\\nI often take out of town visitors here to eat.  My most recent lunch was a poke (Ahi tuna) salad which in which there was a very generous amount of tuna - and I think it was only $10!  I was very happy.\\n\\nI will keep returning.\", \"We had the kids quesadilla meal as a snack. It was very bland. Should at least serve it with some kind of salsa. I also had an ice cream from their freezer and it was halfway melted. Who likes half melted ice cream? How about making the freezer a little colder? I didn't like the meals here at their first temporary cafe when they first opened the Springs Preserve, and even though they now have a nice and stylish permanent dining facility, the food is still mediocre. Service is pretty prompt and courteous though.\", \"Next time you're bored on a Thursday, come to Springs Preserve for a quick trail run... then swing into the Divine Cafe for Happy Hour from 4-8PM! Or just do the HH, I won't tell anyone.\\n\\nThe fact that a museum/park restaurant has decent food is already a delightful surprise, but throw in a liquor license and happy hour and you've actually got something pretty unique. HH features live jazz and a limited menu of appetizers and seasonal cocktails, not to mention the phenomenal view.\\n\\nKETTLE CHIPS: Brought to the table upon seating, decently fresh and nicely seasoned. Provided ranch for dipping? A fresh salsa would be way better!\\nDEVILED EGGS: four egg halves topped with kalamata olives, simple but tasty, with a low $4 price tag.\\nCHEESEBURGER SLIDERS: Nice chargrilled taste, thick patties, topped with lettuce, tomato, and burger sauce.\\nARTICHOKE AND CHICKEN NAAN: The highlight of our mini-meal! Served like a sandwich, think of a Panini made of naan, filled with cheese, artichoke, a bit of spinach, and strips of grilled chicken. This would make a good lunch option, generous portion.\\n\\nIn addition to all that tasty food, the service changes from walk-up to table service when they transition to HH. The young ladies who attended to us were super friendly and genuine. Looking forward to coming back!\", 'I almost hate to write to this review because sometimes you want to keep a great secret all to yourself. That\\'s what I feel the Divine Café is - it\\'s a place that not many people know about which is a shame because it\\'s such a great place. It\\'s a very open, casual place where the mix of customers seem to all be enjoying their meals. We go to the Divine Café every Saturday unless something comes up or I\\'m out of town and it seems like I always have the burger with cheddar cheese. These burgers are huge and come with either salad, fries, or their homemade chips. They are topped with lettuce, tomato, bacon, and a really great pepper mayonnaise.  I\\'ve had great burgers here in Vegas, but for me all those other burgers don\\'t compare to the burger here. This is the place with the best burgers. I always take the family so I\\'ve \"tasted\" other items from their menu and have to say that I have enjoyed everything I\\'ve tasted there. \\n\\nThe Divine Café is located at the Springs Preserve so after eating we walk the trails or see the exhibits they have to offer. As members we get ten percent off our meal. The staff is always friendly - from the person taking our order to the person who brings the food to the table. It\\'s a great place. The café has a great outdoor seating area that gives you a great view of the city. We love to sit outside and enjoy good company, good atmosphere, and good food.\\n\\nWhen I have out of town guests come to visit you know that before they leave Vegas they are going to the Divine Café.', 'Food is delicious, waiting for the food took a while but it was during the superhero day so it was pretty busy. I wanna come here during Sunday brunch!', \"I truly enjoyed my Memorial Day lunch here with the family. Came to the Spring Preserve butterfly exhibit and had lunch at Divine Cafe don't forget to check in I did you get a free drink! ;( next time! The view is amazing and the dinning room is huge. Very beautiful eating spot with a ginormous wrap around out door patio with lots of tables and chairs to eat  outside. \\n\\nThe brisket sandwich was delicious in nice toasty pretzel bun and yummy bacon and crispy onions strips. The side season fries were perfect. My wife got the medium rare burger and it was juicy and yummy! The Cracker jack popcorn with candied pecans was really good and a sweet treat to end the meal. I really like the strawberry, lemon and mint infused water which is free of charge. \\n\\nAll in all very good place to eat I definitely come back eat here again fairly priced, flavorful food, great view and atmosphere and the service is super friendly!\", \"We just love this place every time! They have fresh food that fits everyone's taste buds. This is great place for kids, work lunch and groups. The view of the strip and downtown is amazing too!\", 'I\\'ve been meaning to check out this cafe (and the Springs Preserve) for awhile, and am happy to say it\\'s definitely a place I\\'ll be keeping on my \"go to\" list.  As other reviewers have pointed out, you don\\'t need to be a member of Springs Preserve to go to the Divine Cafe, although I would highly recommend making a pleasant day/afternoon of it and seeing the Preserve, along with the Nevada State Museum which is also there on the grounds.   It\\'s extremely interesting, educational and also great if you have out of town relatives or friends who are bored with the same old same old hotels, bars, Strip stuff.  \\n\\nDivine Cafe is wonderful to get away from  the noise, congestion and tourists - that\\'s why so many locals have found it and enjoy going there for a bite.  It\\'s located on the second floor near the Origen building.  You can take the elevator or stairs to get there.  It\\'s a very open, clean and attractive space with indoor and outdoor patio seating.  If you sit on the patio/deck as I did, you can get a beautiful panoramic view of the surrounding area, the Preserves, and off in the distance, the Strip. On a lovely day with cooler weather, it\\'s certainly one of the more pleasant destinations around!\\n\\nYou order your food from a nicely varied menu that serves up food every bit as good as any restaurant in town. As others have pointed out, this is not some cheapo snack bar with crappy burgers and hot dogs.  This is quality food.   When you place your order, they give you a cute little table holder with your order number.  You can sit anywhere you like, indoor or outside.    Yes, the prices are a bit on the high side, thus my four stars, however, it may be worth it to you for the location and quality.  I had the Angus burger ($9.50) and it was very good.  High quality beef, bacon strips, arugula leaves instead of the usual lettuce....I was very pleased! I ordered it \"well done\" and guess what?  It was cooked PERFECTLY!  None of that icky red beef that seems to be the \"in\" thing for burgers these days.  And the meat patty was still wonderfully juicy and had that top sirloin flavor that you\\'d expect from high quality beef. The bacon strips were also perfect - neither too thick nor too thin, crunchy yet not chewy as is often found on burgers today.  It  came with fries which were nicely seasoned, crisp, and flavorful.    \\n\\nIn addition to the burger, I had the hazelnut beignets which came with TWO yummy dipping sauces - raspberry and caramel.  Price:  $6.00.  Again, a bit pricey but there was enough for two, so it was definitely splittable.  Total:  a bit over $16.00.  But hey, this is sort of a unique place, in the Preserves, with a view, so I guess you\\'d have to say you\\'re paying for the ambiance.  The food is very good and is really  better than other places I\\'ve been, both on and off the Strip.  Bottom line, I\\'d for sure go back and would be happy to bring out of town visitors here for an enjoyable day of browsing the Spring Preserves and then topping it off with a lovely lunch/brunch on the patio looking out at the view. You can also order beer and wine, although I didn\\'t check that out.  I can see how it would be really nice to sit with a drink for awhile there.   Servers and staff were friendly helpful and very professional.    \\n\\nDivine Cafe opens at 11am (weekdays), 10am on weekends (brunch),  and closes  at 3pm, so be sure to time your Preserves browsing to end  back at Divine Cafe around 1:00 or so, you don\\'t want to feel rushed to eat and leave by 3pm.   Thanks Divine Cafe, for a very enjoyable meal!  Looking forward to doing brunch next time and having  the french toast! I\\'m sure it\\'s fab!', \"A four star just for the view alone...if you sit in the outdoor area that is. I've been lucky in that each time I've eaten here, I get a primo seat on a primo day and you can look out over the Preserve and far beyond. Very nice.\\n\\nAs for the food - it's good too. Used to be a Wolfgang Puck branded place, menu is a little different now, in fact they offer a good daily special board. It's run by the Culinary Institute now.\\n\\nHad their BBQ pork sandwich, served with homemade crinkle cut chips (very tasty). The BBQ sauce was very smokey flavored, thick and a good balance of sweet and savory. Well done Culinary Institute! \\nThey offered a roasted butternut squash soup which was nicely prepared/presented (in fact all their food is) and tasted good.\\n\\nIt's a nice place to relax a bit in between or after checking out the Preserve.\", \"Went there for the Thursday happy hour. Had a  glass of the cabernet on happy hour. Tasted great...so I had two. \\n\\nThe bacon and date flatbread was excellent and I'm not a big fan of dates. I would come back and order that though. I would give that five stars.  \\n\\nI was not impressed with the sliders on the happy hour menu. Actually very very disappointing. The whoopie sauce was basically ketchup and the buns tasted dry like they had been sitting out for days. The meat was way overcooked and lacked any flavor. \\n\\nI had a bite of the lotsa mozza salad. It was good. It didn't look like a traditional salad. It was on a polenta cake that tasted like cornbread and had marinara and arugula on top. It was quite good. I would recommend trying it. \\n\\nAlso had the chicken Verde nachos. They were huge! Not very impressed with the taste though but nothing really that bad about them either. \\n\\nJust whatever you do don't get the sliders or else you may never come back. Glad the other people I came with ordered better than I did and let me sample a little bit of everything on the happy hour menu. Had a nice time and the view on the patio was spectacular.\", 'I was expecting event type food at a really high price. But what I actually got was a big cheeseburger with good meat and seasoned fresh fries. I was blown away. Price was good for what I got.', \"Everything about this cafe is amazing. The food, the service and of course the view. You can bring your kids for a great lunch and some fun or even happy hour with friends for a glass of wine and a perfect shot of the strip. \\n\\nThe catering that comes out of this place is fantastic as well, I have now had several events catered by them and have never had a bad dish. In fact, the majority of dishes that I've had, I've begged for the recipe. \\n\\nYou absolutely cannot go wrong with Divine Cafe.\", \"Here's the thing about the food there.  While it is tasty, it is so overly expensive.  I would recommend eating offsite, if you can.\", 'What do I love about this restaurant!? I adore being able to sit outside on the terrace and eat my lunch. I love the variety of food they offer and the specials. It is near my work so every now and then I come over and dine here. I really enjoy their fresh, creative salads, the flatbreads are tasty and just last week I tried the special being tacos since it was Taco Tuesday. The service is good and looking out over the Springs Preserve into the city is absolutely beautiful not to mention relaxing. I love that they have a happy hour on Thursdays where one can come have a drink and listen to some music before heading home. As we all know driving up the 95 kinda stinks at the old 5:00 hour. They also offer creative cooking classes which I have yet to try as I am not Giada but maybe I will get around to it someday. This is a great kick back spot and we need to support this place. Do yourself a favor and give it a try!', \"I have always enjoyed Divine Cafe until my most recent experiences. Our family has a membership at the Springs Preserve, so we eat there often. There was a recent menu change, and some of the dishes are now expensive relative to what you get. During my last visit there on a quiet weekday, it took the staff forty minutes and five tries to get my overpriced and mediocre quality meal correct. The employees were apologetic on behalf of the kitchen, and I was given a voucher for a future free lunch. While I appreciate the staff's efforts to make things right, I'm not sure we'll return to the cafe even with a Springs Preserve membership and a free lunch voucher.\", 'I have been a Springs Preserve member since 2011. Dining at the Café has been part of our experience for a beverage, meal, brunch event, shaded place to sit and a great view. \\n\\nThe Divine Café offers vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free (GF) (including a 9\" pizza for an additional fee) foods. Odwalla non-GMO shakes are available. \\n\\nI appreciate my 10% discount as a member.

Perfect experience, I'll be going back every week for lunch.\", \"Woah, this is some tasty stuff and huge portions for the adults! It is pricey but that is to be expected.  Wish the sides for the kids were a little bigger but other than that, I wouldn't change anything. This place was very clean, and ran like a well oiled machine. I wish you could just come here to dine without admission!\", 'There aren\\'t many restaurants more \"under the radar\" than Divine Cafe at Springs Preserve. It\\'s out of the way for most tourists visiting the Strip or Downtown and it\\'s a destination most locals don\\'t think of when looking for a meal, unless you\\'re also visiting the exhibits at Springs Preserve. With a kitchen led by Steve Piamchuntar (former chef and owner of Nosh & Swig) they\\'re serving up some surprisingly good dishes for lunch and brunch.\\n\\nChef Steve has brought his refined skills and whimsical and modern touch to this cafe. With their recently changed menu they\\'re offering a diverse menu with plenty for adults and kids, alike. Standard American fare like caesar salads, burgers, and pizzas are available. While the burger ($9.50) was decent, non-typical dishes make this place shine compared to other cafes in town. Singapore chicken cups ($9.50) are lettuce wraps with balanced sweetness and savoriness. The pressed chicken milanese ($11) is a must. It eats like a sandwich but has flavors that are fitting for any larger meal. For brunch the pan dulce french toast ($8) was great. More like a creamy bread pudding with bread soaked through with custard, it\\'s perfect for those wanting to satisfy their sweet tooth early in the day. And, to polish off a meal try the root beer float ($6). It\\'s accompanied by an Oreo dusted churro that\\'s as good as any you\\'ll find in town.\\n\\nMy meal was fully comped, but I did tip appropriately. They\\'re typically only open for lunch or brunch, but are open Thursdays and have happy hour specials and live music.', 'This is a great spot for lunch. \\nPrices are reasonable. \\nFood  is really good. \\nPortions are generous.\\nThey have a really good selection  of iced tea. \\nI have been here several times, and will keep coming back.\\nCan bring the family or meet for a business lunch.\\nLots of parking.\\nI have never had a bad experience here.\\nVegetarian options.\\nDefinitely  would recommend.', 'Line was not too long to order.

The presentation is top notch at an affordable prices', \"Talk about a hidden gem.  \\n\\nThe Divine Cafe at the Springs Preserve is serving up some good eats and it doesn't seem that many people know about it.

All that matters now is that you should come and check it out.\\n\\nThe patio has a great view of the Strip or you can sit inside where there are plenty of tables as well as high-tops.  Located at the Springs Preserve, I've seen a mixture of customers, from business folks having lunch meetings to moms and kids eating before or after their time exploring the Preserve.  Being in the Springs Preserve is part of what makes this café so divine:  you can use the trails to walk or run, visit the museums, then grab a bite here.  \\nThe menu offers salads, small bites, burgers, sandwiches, pizza (gluten-free crust available), a kids' menu, plus the excellent desserts.  You should come here if you want to have the root beer float with the Oreo-dusted churro or the Hazelnut Chocolate Beignets or just have both; I've had both and they're both highly recommended.\\nService has been top-rate and there is just an overall relaxed vibe here with people enjoying the atmosphere and their meals.\\nDiscover Divine Café soon and see what you've been missing.\\n\\nHOURS:\\nMonday-Friday: 11:00am-3:00pm\\nSaturday-Sunday:  10:00am-4:00pm\\nHAPPY HOUR ON THURSDAYS:  4:00pm-8:00pm\\n\\n*Note: you can get a trail pass for free if you just want to walk the grounds without paying for the museums or exhibits, especially if you come on a regular basis.

I want to come back and try their happy hour or brunch, too, when I have more time! The only downside is each time I've been in there's only been a few people in line to order at the counter, usually only one person taking the orders, and it's been very slow. The last time it took over 20 mins to get through the three of us in line, and that's half the time I have for my lunch.

I was excited to try this place, especially for the occasion, as I had heard such wonderful things. Unfortunately, today it was quite disorganized and the staff didn't seem entirely sure of what was happening. \\n\\nWe were offered beverages but told that any alcohol would be an extra charge. It was at the end of the meal when we inquired with another server about the inclusion of a mimosa that we received one. \\n\\nThe food was cold, which probably had to do with all of the doors being open and the breeze blowing in. It didn't seem as though the items were made in house and it took some time for items to be replenished. The setup and placement were somewhat strange, too (ie the bacon was placed by the bagels and salmon on a wood tray - so definitely not warm). \\n\\nWhen my family got up to use the restroom, the server cleared their plates and beverages. We were not offered any refills either. Our server was very sweet, but seemed confused and overwhelmed. We saw her twice during our experience - each time she ran by our table it looked like she was holding too many dishes and needed to put them down. I guess I expected a bit more with the $30 price tag. We stayed maybe an hour and probably won't return.\", 'Excellent food in a relaxing atmosphere. I had a bowl of the pork fajita soup and enjoyed the rich stock, black beans, tomatoes, chunks of pork, and tortilla strips. The ice tea is flavorful.

I was getting tired of seeing the same things on the menu.\\n\\nI have been here several times since the new change - and I have to admit, I like the new changes they have come up with. There are a few staples, but they also incorporate a lot of new dishes, and that has got my taste buds singing.\\n\\nLast time I came out here I had the Bento Box, my daughter the grill cheese, and the other couple I was with shared a burger meal. I loved the Bento Box - a little greasy for the egg roll, but everything else was just right!\\n\\nThe specials are swapped out more frequently - and that is a good change to see! It's nice to see fresh ideas moving in, and get the future generations touch of good meals! You can definitely see the urge to please from the employees as you wait for your food.

(Or if you are there first, then might as well eat here!)\", \"After a couple of hours touring the Springs Preserve I was feeling a bit hungry and thirsty.  I was also kind of hot as late May in Las Vegas is starting to warm up.  To complete my experience I thought I would give Divine Cafe a try.  It did not disappoint.\\n\\nI ordered a burger because I was hungry.  I ordered an iced tea because I was thirsty.  I ordered a salad because I was hot.  It did not take long for my burger to come out.  And it came out perfect.  I asked for medium and that is exactly what I got.  It was still pink in the center and taste like quality fresh beef.  I had juice dripping down to my elbow so you know it wasn't dry.  The toppings were good too.  A nice thick slice of tomato, greens, super crisp bacon.  It was a fantastic burger.  The salad was pretty good too.  I like the greens they used.  And the cucumber slices were a nice touch.  I would have been upset about not having my choice of dressing but it was exactly what I would have ordered anyway.  A delicious vinaigrette.  The one complaint I had about the salad was the 8 inch long stripps of carrot that looked like orange noodles.  They were kind of hard to eat as they were too thin to be picked up by fork the way everything else was.  Other than that, no complaints.\\n\\nI was fortunate that the staff at the order window saw I had left my bag from the gift shop at the counter.  I had a couple of things in there I did not want to leave without.  Like my ball cap and sunglasses.  I was worried when I could not find my bag but then I noticed they had pushed it aside and were waiting for me to collect.  Goodonya, Divine Cafe.\", \"Can't say enough good things about this restaurant!  \\n\\nWe've attended a few of their  special events (Fathers Day, Mothers Day, etc), the Thursday night happy hour numerous times and quite a few regular lunches and we've NEVER been disappointed.  \\n\\nThe food is excellent and very affordable, the service has always been top notch and who could complaine about the fantastic view??\\n\\nIf you're looking for a great place for a brunch, lunch or happy hour, you couldn't do better than Divine Cafe at Springs Preserve!\\n\\nAlso an excellent place to bring out of town guests, such a beautiful place to stroll around after a great meal!\", \"One of the best kept secrets in Las Vegas!!! My family of six stopped by this Sunday after our Walk with a Doc program. Everything was great!! I ordered an eggs Benedict with a prickly pear mimosa and wow!! Seriously, one of the best rendered eggs Benedicts  that I've ever had in Vegas. The eggs were perfectly poached and the Holladaise sauce was light...the other dishes were great, including by a burger on Brioche with butter lettuce. A great way to start a pre-birthday Sunday\", \"Okay, so first of all, my ahi salad was very, very good. Also, cucumber water is always a treat. And, the view is spectacular; one of the best in the city. Now that's out of the way...can we talk price vs portion? My salad was delicious, but for a $10+ salad, I'd appreciate a larger helping. I'm not even asking for more Ahi; there was plenty of that; buy dump on the greens, I can take it. Also, and this was purely circumstantial, though I can imagine it happening often: people's children. Christ on a cracker, can you please control your little zoo animals? Letting your children run, play, roll around on the floor, and use adjoining empty tables as their own jungle gyms is not only rude to other patrons, it demonstrates a significant deficiency in parental ability. To the restaurant: please discourage this kind of obnoxious behavior. I absolutely love the Preserve, but hesitate to bring my friends with me to Divine Cafe, lest we get caught up in some variant Lord of the Flies scenario. Otherwise, thanks for the fresh lunch and the relaxing, refrigerated view on a sunny day.\", 'Hello Ursula.\\nThank you very much for everything that you did for our family and guests.\\nOur sons catering for his Baptism was a very classy affair and everyone was impressed.\\nThe food was gourmet and bountiful. \\nWe will see you real soon, and count on you for many upcoming events.\\nIt was a pleasure to have met you and worked with you.\\nThank you.\\nCharles, Jacqueline and Alex S.', \"This review is solely based on the Mothers Day Brunch . I feel for the price this was a OK experience. We went to the 1-4pm  brunch. Upon arrival there was a bit of line but overall it wasn't that long of a wait at all. When we were seated the family proceeded to head off and get food. They had a Chicken and Waffles station, Carving station, Salad bar and Omelet station that also had bacon and sausage.  The lines to get to each food line were pretty long and it made it difficult with the children but the Chicken was really good and the waffles were delicious.    The longest wait was for the Omelettes which were totally worth the wait but they RAN OUT OF MUSHROOMS . It totally was a buzz kill but the guys working that station were really friendly and did a good job making up for not having my favorite ingredient. I felt like we really didn't have a server at all so I was constantly flagging someone down to try to get our Mimosa or plates cleared off. Most of the desserts were really STALE and just didn't satisfy me at all even though they had a large variety to choose from. I would give this brunch a try again but definitely would choose to go to the morning session.\", 'We go to the preserves often we think it is a great under utilized resource for knowledge for our community.\\n\\nFabulous pace to take the kids and visitors in showing Vegas.  This is our first time eating at the Cafe.  We are happy we went, they have lots of fresh items.  Salads, veggies and whatnot, the salad my man ordered was amazing he loved it, fresh crispy iceberg wedge.  I got the Caesar, yummy.  We also got the CHARCUTERIE a nice basic variety of tasty Cheese and Meats but good.  We finished off with a TURKEY WRAP it was so good, I was so full but ate more then I wanted.  \\n\\nWe of coarse had leftovers and enjoyed them after but for a large lunch we left very happy and will be back!  Yummy :)', 'I have been coming here at lunch this past year.  What makes this place is the food.  The view makes the experience great taking you away during a busy work week with the fantastic view.

      "[\"This Subway is located just inside the Sam's Town Casino lobby. With super nice and friendly help. It was a Tuesday afternoon and not crowded so we were promptly waited on.\\n\\nHubby was in the mood for their meatball sub so I opted to share a foot long and ordered it on Italian bread toasted with provolone cheese. The sandwich artist asked if we would like that double meat and I politely accepted that offer for their $1.50. \\n\\nThe sandwich was tasty, hot and very fresh. The bread was ever so perfectly toasted the cheese was had that perfect string to it when biting into it and pulling back on the bread. The sauce was plentiful and seasoned just right to accent the meatballs to make it all marry together with the sprinkles of parmesan cheese.  \\n\\nThis Subway is on the smaller size but very clean with your usual self serve chips and drink station and actually the cigarette smoke was to a minimum. Nice!!\\n\\nWe'll be back for sure since we are staying at the RV resort here at the property.\", 'Hate to give them only 3 since I am a long-time fan, but have to dock for not very friendly staff (though one off-duty sandwich artist was friendly and helpful), and less than fresh bread.  I tried the new Italian sub; nothing exciting.  I will probably go back to my usual BMT next time; it has more flavor.', \"The amazing thing about this Subway is it's the worst quality in the entire Subway chain.\\nWe've dined at Subways from coast to coast, border to border.\\nEmployees at the Sams Town location have no clue what they are doing and the sandwiches suffer.\\nA whole new definition of indifferent attitude and slow service too.\\n\\nOnly good Subways are where an owner is a hands on operator and this casino location is a ship with no captain. No supervision nor assurance of quality.\\nWatch customers turn around and walk out after waiting long times despite no line with no one in front of them.\\n\\nThis is THE worst Subway you will ever visit.\\nBad food, bad attitudes and very bad service.\\n\\nThe 5 star review is a shill.\"]\n",

Being that people said it was a family friendly place, we were kind of confused. We called them up and the lady was super nice and said it was no problem if we came in and ate. That definitely made us feel better. \\n\\nWe ordered a French Dip, a Geebee Burger, and the potato skins for takeout (back to the comfort in our worldmark condo timeshare). The lady, Diana, was super quick about everything and asked us if we needed anything yadda yadda yadda. She brought us out some water while we waited for our food. \\n\\nOur food was ready in about ten minutes which isn't so bad because you get to look at the totally cheesy yet lovable decor. \\n\\nBig warning about this place: there are no sidewalks to it and there is no crosswalk to it either. From the worldmark, you have to walk down the street then cross three crosswalks to form a uturn shape and then walk on the bike lane. Pretty lame. \\n\\nTotally worth it though. \\n\\nPS: even after walking all the way down the street, taking three crosswalks, and walking back down the street (in the rain)... our food was still blazing hot once we got back.\", 'Good food and great service. Happy hour prices are half off drinks and appetizers. Not a bad place.

Then a guy walks in and puts $5 in and gets a free beer. Wtf ?\\n\\nNever again\\n\\nThis place smells bad, mildew carpet and the locals well lets just say not super friendly\\n\\nI will continue to search for a cool hangout', \"Stopped at Geebee's for lunch a few weeks back. What a nice surprise! A very friendly and relaxed atmosphere and the food was great. I'll definitely be back. In the restaurant area, they also have a kid's menu--I'll try that out on my 2 year old son during our next meal at Geebee's.\", \"Great place! Total dive bar. Pricing is really good, everything on the menu is so good. Breakfast is amazing! Huge portions, omlettes are my favorite. I come here a lot for Sunday breakfast, before we head out to watch the Riader's. \\n\\nIf you take care of the bartender you get some really stiff drinks! They are not afraid to pour a lot extra! haha. \\n\\nThe only bad thing is that their TV's suck! 1994 called, they want their tv's back! Please update your tv's so I can stay and watch sports!\", 'Not located on \"the strip\" but this place is worth the trip.

The food is excellent and the service is great.They give you HUGE portions. The only thing I didn't like was the smell of smoke when you first walk in; it was horrible, but the eating area is nonsmoking and they try to air it out as much as they can. The building looks dirty from outside, but that's part of it's charm. I did not expect this place to be this good;if it wasn't for the other yelpers, I wouldn't have eaten here. I had loaded potato skins and the french dip, and my boyfriend had the Philly cheese sandwich. I don't feel the need to break it all down because it was all very good.However, the potato skins are more like a baked potato; yeah, that big. I will DEFINITELY go back when I'm in Vegas.\", 'We had a Blast in Vegas due to Geebees...our bartender Damion was the best!!!!!!! The food was good and fresh...for it to be bar food.', \"I love Geebee's. I have eaten there a few times and have never been disappointed. I try something new every time. The food is so fresh and we have always had great service. The potato & cheese soup is the best I have ever had. It is not a very attractive business from the outside, but by the time you leave. Who the heck cares, what is inside is so incredible you forget the package.\", \"The front might not be as appealing for some, but once you step inside it more than makes up for it. The interior has an aviation motif with large airplanes hanging down from the cEiling. \\n\\nOnce we sat down, Brandy was quick to greet us and take our drink order. They have a special going 24/7 for $1 PBR. Pabst might not be the finest beer around, but a dollar is nothing to complain about. Maybe it was the price, or the fact that they serve an ice cold draft in an ice cold pint that makes it that much more enjoyable. \\n\\nWhen she came back, my friend and I split the Bonnie's BBQ Burger ($7.99) and a Patty Melt ($7.99). The burger was fan-freakin-tastic. A half pound of juicy beef patty cooked to a perfect medium rare stacked with four large onion rings, BBQ sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and three strips of crispy bacon. With the sandwiches you get a choice of fries, onion rings, rice pilaf, potato salad, or some other items. It is ridiculous the variety of sides offered. There is definitely something for everyone. The Patty Melt is served on marbled rye and was good. After biting into the burger, it paled in comparison. We would have been happy with a burger each. I got an order of onion rings with it and they were well seasons, crispy and everything an onion ring should be. It is difficult to find good onion rings because they can be overcooked, doughy, or absorb all the oil. These are the best I have had in a while.\\n\\nSometimes, I just crave a good burger and some fried goodness. I would be willing to come here again. Especially since they have shuffleboard. Shuffleboard+Cheap Booze+Food=  An Epic Night\", 'i decided to give this bar a chance since is just across the street from the hotel and i had great experience!  food is amazing and very cheap, great bar, people are local and very friendly, if you are in vegas you should definitely stop by!', \"Best breakfast sammy in Vegas.

Aw well, we still had fun playing on the salt covered table, sipping cocktails and enjoying the best breakfast sandwich (awesome potatoes too!!!).\\n\\nI've had a couple other items here as well, but I keep coming back to that damn breakfast sandwich...\", \"GeeBee's breakfast sangwich is to die for.

We stayed down the street at one of the hotels and this place was convenient because its open 24 hours. Not only that the food was good. We went at like midnight and drank until 4am laughing and playing music on the music player. Loved that we went in out yoga pants and flip flops and didn't spend a ton of money.

Most dishes are $9.99, great lunch, burgers cooked to order with different toppings on it.   Very large portions. Owner was very friendly as was the staff.  I'd visit again.  The building is old but they've done a great job fixing it up in an airplane motif.\", \"The food was OK and ther service nice but I didn't see anything special. It was raining outside and the roof was leaking... I don't see this as anything but a local watering hole\", \"Was doing some Christmas Shopping with my Son and decided to stop by this joint based on the great reviews we saw on Yelp.  I've passed this place at least 100x and have never stopped to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.\\n\\nBetween the two of us, we ordered Wings w/Med Sauce ($10), Sliders w/Fries ($10), and Momma's BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger w/half Fries & half Onion Rings($10).  Our server Joanna, who was very nice, helped us select these items.  First up was the Wings.  They were pretty good.  Joanna recommended getting the Med Sauce for the flavor but having the Hot Sauce on the side for the heat.....it worked!  It was very good.\\n\\nMy Son had the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and it was huge!  He said he enjoyed it.  I tried some of his Onion Rings....they were thick, crunchy, Beer-battered, and soooo good!  The Onions had a nice sweet flavor to them that went well with the Beer-batter crust....pure awesome!\\n\\nMy Sliders were pretty good....I wouldn't say they were great, but good.  They were slightly overcooked....well done.  I think the cook took them off the grill Med-Well and then it got Well-Done between the kitchen and the table.  They had good flavor though and the Bread was really good...the best part of the dish.\\n\\nOverall, we had a great lunch and Joanna was especially helpful.  She has a great personality and made us feel welcome and special.\\n\\nWill we return?  We spotted a few other items on the menu we want to try, so next time we're in the area, we plan to come back.\", \"This place is really really good!!! Our first time trying this place.

Planning on having breakfast there again tomorrow!!', \"Pretty awesome. My friend has lived here for 4 years and she said this is some of the best breakfast around. After going there, I have to agree!! I had the country benedict and she had eggs and bacon. Together, with a tip, our meal was under $20. The meals came with has browns or home fries (I got hash browns, she got home fries -- I had some of both though) and her's came with toast. The sausage was amazing and the eggs were poached to perfection! The hash browns were seasoned just right and not overcook. The home fries were crispy and flavorful. The atmosphere was pretty neat, too! Lots of old airplane things. Would definately go there again. :-)\", 'The burgers are huge and ingredients are fresh.  The nice thick slices of tomato and hand-formed burger patties shows the restaurant isn\\'t trying to cut corners.  Someone needs to clone the chef; this is what a \"medium\" pink burger should look like.  I haven\\'t had burger cooked that perfectly in years.  The onion rings are better than most, the Quesadilla with all the side ingredients was very cool and the potato wings were huge and perfect.  I wish I could have tried the spicy chicken wings, but no one at the table was looking for the adventure.  However, the basic wing sauce is delicious.  Go for happy hour...four people drinking with three appetizers got out of there for less than $40.', 'This place is soo cool.  A group of us were waiting for a shuttle to the strip butit never came so we partied all night at GeeBees. We bought so many drinks and food and the bill only came out to $60. I would go to vegas just to go back there again. We had such a good time there. And the guys played shuffleboard so the girls could have a good time. 10% off if you have a timeshare at worldmark.', 'From the outside, this place looks like a dirty locals bar.

A bar w/ video poker, a shuffleboard game, and some areas to chill back in.\\n\\nWe ate and drank for super cheap, and the food was REALLY GOOD. I had the French Dip, and it was absolutely delicious.\\n\\nIt looks like a dirty bar, but ended up being a diamond in the rough. If you\\'re in the area south of \"The Strip\" or better yet, staying at the WorldMark or Budget Budget (yes that\\'s 2 Budget\\'s) Suites across the street, it is 100% worth a stop!', \"So, I'm not saying that GeeBee's needs its own special trip but I would stop in again if I found myself on that side of the strip. Why you would find yourself a few miles south of Luxor I have no idea but keep GeeBee's in mind... \\n\\nWe found ourselves in the parking lot of GeeBee's  looking for a late dinner.

He checked that we had enough sauces, drinks (refilling when drinks were not even half empty!), even napkins! We ordered a burger plus a side each. My husband wanted two different sides and they gave us the second as a courtesy of the house. I recommend this place to everyone who is after a good and unexpensive meal.

I liked it as well, as the Gnocchi was both firm and tender and the meat sauce was very tasty.  They serve a very nice full serving and she brought some home for leftovers, there was so muhc.\\n\\nI tried the Fettuccini aglio e olio with vegetables and asked for Vegan style, since my daughter is vegan and I was gonna give her some leftovers.  This was a fantastic dish. The fettuccini is home made, al dente, and the mix of garlic and oil was just right.  I really enjoyed the simple taste.  The veggies were cooked perfectly and very tasty as well.  I did not leave as much for her as leftovers as I intended...\\n\\n2.  The pizza - ordered a large Pizza Capricchiosa, mozzerella, tomato sauce, artichokes, olives, ham and mushroom.  This was an excellent pizza, the mix of ingredients were just right.

Caprese and Garlic Knots - We ordered the Insalata Caprese to start and the mozzarella and tomatoes were fresh, and mixed with oil and balsamic just the right way.  We enjoyed this very much.  The garlic knots were so fresh and so easy to eat.  I am afraid that if you don't control yourself, you will end up eating way too much.\\n\\nWe brought a lot of the food home, as we were really sampling what they had.  We also enjoyed their Pinot Grigio and Chardonnay.  The espresso coffee was also great. \\n\\nAll in all, a good place, good price and great service from everyone there.\\n\\nI will be back.\", 'Came in from Los Angeles for a couple on days. We wanted good Authentic Southern Italian food. My brother & I are super picky & always eat Veal Parm. We both got that & so did my hubby. OMG it was just like what you get in NY or NJ. The veal was so soft & the portions were very large. The decor was warming & homey. We will be back on our next trip in a couple of weeks. Excellent food, fast Service & efficient waiters. If you like southern Italian then you must try this Restaurant.', 'Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Bravo! The vodka sauce is EXTREMELY hard to put down when you have them with garlic knots. The lobsta ravioli is one of if not THE best ravioli dishes in Las Vegas. The service was great and they keep the place looking authentic but not run down. The fried rice balls with marinara was an awesome appetizer. Total bill for 2 with glass of wine each and app was $60. Such a great place, will definitely return!', \"The food is great here it's my first time here and it was amazing. I got the fettuccine Alfredo and it's was extremely good nice intimate place to for a nice little date night.\", \"This place is legit. I am not really into Italian food but this place made me love Italian food. The place is located sort of strip mall and from outside, it looks nothing extraordinary but taste they offer is whole different league.  Everything tastes homemade and I think they actually make everything from scratch.  \\n\\nWe had Carbonara with Chicken and Bolognese with meat sauce and both dishes were best Italian food I've had in my life.  Carbonara was really on point especially for me, because that Pancetta fat was like heaven on earth.  We also grabbed some Cannolis on our way out and we regret so much we didn't grab a dozen of them.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and visit here again.\\n\\nHighly recommended!\", 'Much love to Pasquale and Dion, not only was the food amazing!!  but its so nice to have that extra personal touch where your treated like family. \\nSalute!!! To my now new favorite place! All I can say is...DELIZIOSO!!! Mangia!\\nGRAZIE :)))\\nDanielle~', \"While this may look like any of the standard little Italian restaurants in strip malls, it's probably one of the best in the area! Most of the staff and owners are Sicilian, and over 80% of them speak with heavy Italian accents. The food and sauces are all extremely well prepared, with a number of surprises. And the desert counter, which are all freshly made here on premises, look and taste like an old world Italian pastry shop.\\nAll the appetizers and entrées have surprising flavors and composition. The one not to miss is the calamari appetizer, which also has Italian tempura vegetables and shrimp in it. This is an entrée and itself. Also under the appetizer menu are the clams and mussels marinara. The sauce is spicy, but you can ask for the regular tomato sauce which is delicious.\", 'I had the pleasure of dining here for a luncheon through Chicagoans In The Desert.  I was very impressed!  As an Italian, I can be rather critical of any Italian food I am presented with, but I can say I enjoyed my meal very much.  I enjoyed their tortellini soup, shared some of my friends salad which was beyond generous in portion and had all the good stuff in it - fresh mozzarella balls, olives, artichokes, etc., and I opted to have the spaghetti and meatballs for my entree.  Let me just say....their meatballs are FANTASTIC!  I thought the gravy (yes I said GRAVY) could have had a little more \"oomph\", but oh em gee those meatballs!  They they provided us with platters of cookies on the table...not a single one disappointed!  The staff worked very hard to please all us women, and the place is clean and comfortable.  My biggest disappointment about my visit was I forgot my leftovers!\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t hesitate to come back to this restaurant!', \"Wonderful service, great food, reasonable prices... You're missing out of you don't try it.\", \"Really enjoy the atmosphere, food and service! They make a wonderful tiramisu and lots of other desserts. Every dish from appetizers to entrees were great. Ate here several times. Try the special seafood pasta, calamari and salads. All great, they never dissapoint. Can't wait to go back!\", \"Delicious!!! The energy from the staff was loving and warm, the food was immaculate and it was busy! A very good sign. We had reservations on a Saturday night, they do a great business at being attentive. The seafood I had was very fresh, along with the tasty antipasti! DEFINITELY make your way into here. Oh! And they're very clean hehe! Caio! Gratzi!\", 'Tonight I decided to order our dinner and have it delivered. I used the GrubHub app for delivery. Lasagna , Meatballs and a Fettuccine pasta with cherry tomatoes and olive oil. Very easy process to order thru the app. Food arrived as promised on time. The problems as I see them are this. Carry out package is simple foil tins with paper tops. Really not designed to keep food warm and leak free. The Grubhub folks use the standard insulated bags for transport. The time to get to my house from the restaurant is literally 15 minutes tops. Well the food had to be reheated and the lasagna leaked thru the top lid. So many new modern to- go type containers are available that are microwave friendly. I recommend that they use this type. Sure they cost a bit more but add on the price for carry out. They already do. The food my guess wasnt that hot when the delivery guy showed up to get the order. Quality was average. I prefer Buon Gusto or Bootlegger. Just saying', \"Wow. Great little restaurant run by, of all people, Italians! We went for my wife's birthday. My wife and son had the arinchini. There were two big ones in a very mild and delicious marinara sauce. I had the tortellini soup. I was stunned when they brought it out because it looked more like an entree. It was huge and again, very good. She had the veal parm and the boys had the chicken parm. Again, just outstanding. We haven't had good southern Italian comfort food like this since we left Boston 17 years ago. This is now our go to Italian restaurant. Oh, and the service if warm, friendly, and Italian. Buon gusto!\", \"So happy with my first visit...went back and brought some folks.   Not the same from either a food or service perspective.\\n\\nHope they get it together.  we have lots of Italian in this neighborhood and average isn't going to cut it.\", 'Excellent!!!!  The bread knots with the olive oil are addictive!   My Wife had the Chicken Picatta.  The sauce was perfect and definitely made from scratch...not over powering and/or thick like most places we have been.   I had the baked penne...again, perfect!  The sauce was a great bolognese and the pasta was perfect al dente!   The service was absolute tops and were treated like family.  We would highly recommend!!', 'Waited about an hour for the food..It is not an ideal place to go back for Italian food..$60 worth of food that we did not get to enjoy just because of the wait and as we walked out we notice the table that used to be empty have their food serve already..', 'Dinner was great again and our service was terrific.  Shared a bottle of wine and too many rolls (soooo good).  I had Pasta E Fagioli soup and linguini pesto and BH had Vodka sauce over gluten free pasta and a lovely serving of broccoli.  Our go to Italian restaurant.  :)', \"The best eggplant parmigiana I have ever had. Bar none. Ever. Try the tiramisu for dessert. Absolute heaven. The pesto is to die for. Everything here is first rate including the personal service. We're hooked!\", 'Third time eating here. Food is consistently good. Tried the penne bolognese...very good. My wife had a chicken dish ....also very good\\nwill try the meatballs next time\\nVery much like you might find in little italy in new york if you get past the strip mall location.', 'First time we tried today everything is fantastic!!! Fried calamari! Chicken piccata !!! Antipasto!! Cannelloni all delicious !! We will be going back for more !!! Nice people too !!', 'Fantastic restaurant; family owned, all home cooked from scratch, reasonably priced, wonderful atmosphere, great wines and fantastic service Great for a romantic dinner or large party. Private party rooms opening soon. Stop in and have a great conversation with the owners or enjoy your privacy. Try the pizza or a meal it all is delicious. You will not be let down. Give the owners feedback if you are not thrilled with your meal and they will make you happy. Great place to go if you want something off strip with excellent food.', 'Stopped in while my phone was being worked on at Sprint. The pastry case is amazing, the insalata italia was so delicious and the minestrone was home made and one of the best I have tasted.  \\n\\nVisiting was a complete accident, but the return will not be.', 'Definitely not a replacement for Montesanos. Average food at best and terrible service. We were one of four tables being served during lunch and the server spent more time behind the front counter than helping guests.', 'Amazing place! We had the Margarita Pizza, the Caesars Salad and the Fresh Pappardelle Con Asparagi e Pillo! AMAZING!!! Very nice employees and owners. We will be back and suggest to others. Thank you!', \"First time trying this new establishment. Was a frequent guest at Montesanos and was sad to see them go. As some of the previous reviewers have said, I also didn't think anything could replace them, but my expectations have been exceeded. From the complementary bread to the pasta and home made desserts, everything was overall excellent. My group tried the spaghetti and meatballs, eggplant parm and the pizza. The pasta, sauce and cheeses were all very fresh. I wouldn't say the pizza was quite as good as I had hoped, but still very solid. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I will definitely be back soon.\", \"Still love the food at the restaurant however I do have one complaint. The music. I'm sorry but I don't think rap music is appropriate as ambiance for a wonderful Italian restaurant. Nothing against rap music as I love all music but not for the Italian experience and not loud as it was. \\n\\nMaybe re-think music choice?  Thanks\", \"My in-laws took us to this place last night, saying it was one of the best Italian places they'd ever been too!\\nAfter last night... I'll never doubt their epicurean recommendations!\\nThis place was AMAZING!!  \\nTwo of us had the spaghetti and meatballs... three meatballs with this entree proved too much for us to eat while there!! (See picture) \\nOne has the spaghetti with hot peppers (can't remember the name) and she loved it!!  The other had the meatball appetizer with a bed of angel hair pasta  (he is not crazy about having a lot of marinara sauce!!\\nAt the end of the night, we were all VERY happy with our choices!!\\nBe sure to save room for dessert!\", \"like any other small family own Italian restaurant \\nFriend service of course that they own business of course they're going to get a lot of 5 starts because have a personalized service than other places organization they need a little bit more yeah not too many people got that welcome on the tables are too close together is half of the server not to be taking an order putting your butt in other people's faces pasta dishes are quite large we had a pizza like any other Pizza any other place except for Domino's of course LOL the next door is empty space that might be a good idea if the rental place to to have enough room and the place looks like a regular restaurant\", 'The food and service were both excellent - exceeded expectations.  I had the Insalata Italia and it was big, fresh and the dressing was light yet tasty. After that the spaghetti with meatballs were delicious. No room for desert this time, but they looked amazing.', 'Felt like real italian food when I was in Vegas last week. Yelp reviews were incouraging but they didn\\'t communicate the nice reception I recieved so close to closing time. The unhurried attention (even though I was last customer), and the quality of the food, made me feel like I was in a neighborhood \"joint\" in Queens, northern NJ or south philly. Homemade pasta and seafood specials were enticing, but still ordered the Veal Parm that I was craving and was not disappointed. House chianti was quite reasonably priced and complimentary.', \"Great food amazing staff our food came out so fresh it was still smoking hot it was a great environment loved every thing about it. Doesn't look like much from the location but never judge a book by its cover the food and desserts are amazing\", \"Truly a wonderful dining experience. The atmosphere is warm, quaint and inviting. The owners, Santino and Carmela Corso, and the entire crew go out of their way to make dining in their restaurant as though you're family in their home. The flavors and dishes are truly Sicilian as the Corso's are from Palermo! I've dined at Trattoria Italia many times and I've never been disappointed. The display case filled with authentic Italian sweets should not be overlooked. Don't miss this gem on Eastern Ave in Henderson. Your palate will thank you! Buon appetito!\", 'I was here for the first time late yesterday afternoon. The restaurant is warm and inviting, the staff is very friendly and the menu is extensive for such a small spot. Since I was hungry but not for a full meal, I ordered the sausage and pepper sandwich which ended up being a meal in itself. I spoke with one of the owners who advised that everything is made fresh daily and that the meats and cheeses are imported. This place is well worth any amount of driving and I will be back!', \"This is usually our go-to Italian restaurant. Normally I would give it four and a half stars but I've had to change that because the latest meal there the chicken parm was tough as leather. And the arugula salad was mediocre.  The Chianti was very nice though!\", 'Noticed we have a new little family owned Italian restaurant, and was quick to check them out. \\n \\nWe were immediately welcomed and seated by the staff. Our server took our drink orders, and within minutes we had water, a warm bread basket and olive oil. That bread was amazing! \\n\\nWe ordered Cheese Ravioli, and Baked Ziti. Both were delicious! The flavors were on point, enough Cheese, and good portions-especially the Ziti-that was huge! \\n\\nThe service was phenomenal. But then again, they opened only 3 days ago, so its expected. \\n\\nWelcome to the neighborhood, Trattoria! We plan on visiting often. Please keep your prices reasonable, your service great, continue making delicious food, and you will be a success!', \"I was out with friends who have recently moved to town and wanted to get Italian. So I let them to my favorite Italian restaurant. I did a triple take when my beloved Montesanos was not there.  So naturally we wanted Italian food so what a perfect time to try the new local Italian restaurant.  And I'm very happy that we did. We were greeted and seated by one of the owners named Pascal?  We were served by his sister whose Name Escapes Me but who had a lovely personality and attentive service. There were four in our party and we all ordered different dishes. The chicken alfredo , sausage and peppers sandwich , lasagna, followed by hand filled cannoli.  Everyone agreed their food was excellent. I'm so happy that the family-owned restaurant I lost has been replaced by a family-owned restaurant I am certain I will come to love.  It truly feels to me like a newer version of one of my old favorites.  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience, excellent service, and relaxed atmosphere.  Not only will I be back, but I will bring more friends and family!\\n\\nPlease forgive any grammatical errors as I did this review on my voice app. :-)\", 'The food here is amazing!  The environment is warm and cozy. The Cioppino we had was delicious. The portions are huge you can honestly split the pastas with 2 people!  \\nWe orders the Tiramisu for desert  and it was absolutely amazing as well. I highly recommend coming here. \\nService was amazing!', \"This is a long-awaited welcome addition to SE Las Vegas for authentic Italian food made by real Italians. They've included a few dishes for the American sensibility of Italian food but the pasta is perfect and made in house.

Most are New York Italian but this is the first (off-strip) since (old) Roma Deli that is actually run by Italians! \\n\\nThis is no deli though. It\\'s a Trattoria which is a type of restaurant in Italy where you can enjoy home cooked Italian food for a reasonable price, and this is exactly that type of establishment.\\n\\nThe dad comes in the morning to cook the sauces, dolci etc. and then the rest of the family come in throughout the day to operate the restaurant. You can tell as soon as you step through the door that the place has a buzz. The decor is cosy and warm but I think it\\'s the personalities that really make the atmosphere what it is. \\n\\nI love good food & wine, hearing the chattering of people, the clinking of glasses and the waiters talking back and fourth in Italian because it reminds me of Italy. Some lady on the table next to me wasn\\'t a fan of the guys speaking in Italian or something and complained; I was relieved when I heard the owner tell her politely that if she doesn\\'t like people speaking in Italian then maybe this wasn\\'t the place for her.\\n\\nCan\\'t wait to come back!

Our new favorite place. Amazing food, friendly service. The lasagne and profiteroles were amazing. We were looking for a great quality Italian restaurant without the Strip prices and found it. I was particularly impressed with the desserts. I'm kind of hard to please, since I usually like the desserts I make better than what most restaurants serve, even when they make it themselves (they're typically too sugary), but these were so good (my husband got the cannoli. Best in town!)\\n\\nCan't wait until they have outside seating next week.\", \"This place is amazing. They have really good authentic Italian food. I've always went to a different Italian place that is a little farther but they have went downhill so I decided to give it a try one night with my family.

The service is really nice and everyone is super friendly. \\nI ordered the chicken Marsala and I was not disappointed. It tasted authentic and amazing; there isn't anything bad I can say! We also tried chicken Alfredo, seafood risotto, and a pizza.\\nThey have a lot of pastry's and desserts that I didn't get to try but they looked very good.\\nDefinitely give this place a try and see what you think!\", \"My husband and I really wanted to like this place. We were previously pretty dedicated to Montesano's as our regular pizza place and, like apparently a lot of people, desperate to find a suitable replacement -- that it would be located in the exact same space would just be a convenient bonus. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the search continues. :-/\\n\\nWe did a large half cheese/half pepperoni, it was just over $16 (there's a $1 charge for take out, apparently, which is...fine ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯) and it was incredibly mediocre. I think the photo kind of speaks for itself, but it was basically the taste/look of a pizza they'd serve in a high school cafeteria. It definitely is pizza, but it's not really what you wanted. \\n\\n(It's about the same level of fulfillment as Blaze, just down the street, in my opinion. Definitely not the  new regular spot I was so ardently hoping for.)\\n\\nThe guy that answered the phone was super nice and the staff inside was nice, and it's possible that their actual entrees are where they excel and the pizza is just an afterthought, but for our experience, and what we were looking for them to do, it comes up pretty short.\", \"We went for dinner with friend's on NYE. The food was good, except for the my husband's order was wrong. The service from beginning to end was horrible. \\n\\nWe had to reach out to our server to get our drinks. We never got bread when every table around us did. When the meal came I realized I was not getting my soup :(\\n\\nThe food was good but it was not very hot. We then ordered coffee and that was not hot. We did receive a comped desert of cookies and mini cannoli's. The table agreed that was the best part of this experience.\\n\\n When my husband received the check the server told us that she said she was sorry once already. She then took $9.00 off the check. \\n\\nAll my husband's customers had good things to say. We had high hopes. We were good customer's of Montesanto's.

My favorite place to go to when I'm craving for some authentic italian food\", 'Love this place. I was in town visiting family and I asked them to recommend something local, unique (no chain restaurants, off the strip).  This place fit the bill.  We were seated right away and the service was outstanding throughout the meal. Atmosphere is very comfortable (except I agree with the other Yelp review about the poor choice of \"background\" music).   Arancini, caprese, pappardelle gamberi, spaghetti & meatballs were all excellent, but a bit overpriced so I can\\'t give it 5 stars.

Don't be deterred by it's strip mall location, this place is worth it. My family and I just finished dinner at this lovely, authentic Italian restaurant. All of us were supremely satisfied with our meals. The lasagne was the best I've had since I visited Florence. I can never finish a whole meal, but this time I cleaned my plate. Two of our party highly recommend the flavorful and filling gnocchi ninni. Before our meal, we shared the Caesar salad. It was enough to share between four of us and the dressing was fresh and delicious. After dinner, our friendly and attentive server, Danny, surprised us with two profiteroles-chocolate and coffee. Both were devoured within a couple minutes, even though we were stuffed. Seriously, make time to eat here.\", 'This place is great. Easy to get seated and the food was delicious! On top of that the service was excellent! I recommend the fettuccine alfredo and insalata Italia. Molto bene!', \"I've been on the hunt for a traditional Italian spot in the Henderson area for quite some time. What I have mostly found is disappointed and terrible food, until today when I found Trattoria Italia.\\n\\nWhen you pull up it looks like a extremely small store in a strip mall. I was expecting 5 tables and a counter. When entering you're presented with two dining rooms which could easily seat 70 people. The place looks rustic and very much what you find in Italy. There are quite a few family size tables and the decor makes you feel at home. Sinatra was on the radio and the staff treats you like family. There were wine racks in the dining room as well as a wooden shelf with various items like olives, olive oil, canned tomatoes, pasta, etc. The lighting was dark but it fit the mood.\\n \\nI found through speaking to the owner that it is family owned and they are from Sicily. Both him and the chef had a very thick accent and they were very humble. As guests entered I noticed that they were conversing in Italian with the owner. This place really seems like the local Italian spot in Henderson.\\n\\nAs for the food: I have finally found an Italian restaurant that doesn't over cooked pasta and freeze meatballs. The food is obviously fresh and the chefs puts his heart into the food.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this place to friends.\", 'Wow wow wow. Amazing food, adorable ambiance, great staff. Definitely a new favorite!', \"Best Italian in Henderson!!! Five star  - authentic and perfectly cooked dishes here.  Quality par to NYC Italian restaurants.  At last good Italian in the Vegas area (not counting the Strip 5-Star Hotels).  This place has nice ambiance, a nice dessert & pastry glass showcase in the entrance - they also have delicious desserts here! Take them to go if you are too full after your meal.  We'll be back for more!\", \"Visiting from California and looking for something off the strip. The food was amazing! Came with a group of 6 and everyone loved their meals. You can't go wrong try this place!\", \"The food so far has been delish. Good friends good food. As far as service it's fine, food is awesome.

Unbelievable service, tremendous selection of delicious food..from appetizers to desserts this is as good as it gets !!! When you are here IT IS FAMILY without a doubt !!', \"This place was absolutely delicious and the way that this restaurant was decorated is so cute! How can you put your fork down with a pasta this good? I'm glad we came here today because we're definitely going to come more often. Thank goodness it's just down the street! If I can rate 5 or more stars, then I would.\", \"I really wanted to like this restaurant more. We came with friends who had eaten here many times and raved about it. That set the bar very high - maybe that was the problem. Our server was Santini, the owner. Very personable and very welcoming. Another reason for wanting to like it more. And they honored our reservation when they were very busy on a Saturday night. Still another significant plus.\\nSo why only 3 stars. They brought the bread knots to the table right away. A hold over from Montesano's (the prior Italian restaurant in this location)?? The knots they served were a bit stale as if they had been on the counter in the kitchen way too long. Didn't stop me from eating them, but they really weren't great. We started with a salad. The $9 salad was more than enough for 4 of us to share and still have some left over. A suggestion to Santini - offer a half size salad for $5 so that when I come with just 2 people, I can still order the salad without having to throw out half. For my entree, I ordered the chicken Marsala. It came with a side of pasta. The portion was large - no leaving here hungry. It was good, not great. My wife shared the chicken parmigiana with her friend. They split it in the kitchen for them - a nice touch. And the portion was huge. More than enough for 2 to share. Again, good but not great. My friend ordered the orecchiette with broccoli rabe and sausage. Now that was a good dish.\\nSo overall, it is a solid local Italian restaurant where you can go to eat, but not a place to go to dine. I will try it again. I really do want to like it more.\", 'This Italian tavern has excellent Italian food.\\nThe people that run the place are welcoming and joyful, they are a real Italian family.\\nTrattoria Italia is a must in Vegas!', 'This place is amazing!  Food is authentic Italian, the staff all speak in Italian!  Service and food were great!  This was my first time there and I will definitely be going back!', 'I wish 10 stars was an option to leave for this little gem.  This is one of the best Italian meals that my husband and I have had in a long time.  We have been searching the city for a good Italian restaurant that has eat-in and take-out service and we just hit the jackpot.  The food is spectacular.  We wanted take-out this evening so this was a perfect test to see how good the food was and how well it would hold up for a short drive home.  We started off with the arancini.  One order included 4 enormous, freshly made arancini.  These were the best I ever had.  The order came with a side of sauce.  This was a zesty, home-made sauce, not the sweet stuff that passes for sauce in most Vegas restaurants.  Next, we split a Caesar salad.  The salad was large enough for two.  It was cold, crisp and fresh as a salad should be served.  We both opted for the chicken parmesan this evening.  The chicken parmesan comes with a side of angel hair pasta.  The chicken breast was enormous and so was the portion of pasta.  The chicken was cooked perfectly.  It was juicy and tender, while the breading was crisp.  The pasta was perfectly al dente.  Again, the chicken parm and the pasta was served with a homemade zesty (not sweet) sauce that we have been craving.  This main course also comes with a side of homemade knots.  They were tender and perfectly chewy.  I assume that these are made from their pizza dough as I also make my knots from my homemade pizza dough.  We finished off this perfect dinner with their homemade cheese cake and chocolate cheese cake.  Again, true perfection.  The cakes were not overly sweet but still rich and decadent.  Also of note, when they packed our meals to go they made sure to pack all the hot food in one bag and all the cold food in another.  I cannot tell you how many times we have gotten take-out and other restaurants have put a hot entrée on top of a cold salad or on top of a cold desert.  We have found our new go to for perfect Italian!', 'I ordered the salmon my server Jill suggested and it was absolutely amazing!! Extremely impressed with food and service. Will be back soon', \"Nice little Italian place.  The homemade pastas are delicious along with the sauces.  Not the best water so we usually get pellegrino.  The canolli's are ok.  The filling is good but the shell not so much.  It would be better if they filled them at time of order.  Service isn't the best since they have a small staff so be prepared to wait and reservations a must in the evenings, as there is limited seating.  Overall the place is nice and the meatballs are good too.  We would return because of the good pasta and sauces and authentic feel.  Side note, would love to see fresh grated cheese served instead of the Parmesan.\", \"It's fine.  I wished it was much better.  Dry chicken Parm, sauce is WAY too sweet.\\n\\nService is good, and the other dishes we had were just ok.\", 'We loved Montessanos.  First time here since the change.  We loved it and will be back.  Service was great, food was great.', 'Trattoria Italia is a refreshing authentic italian restaurant. Excellent service and healthy portions.  Perfect for families looking for an affordable night out. Best Value and Quality in Henderson.', \"I've lived and searched Las Vegas for 9 years looking for great Italian food.....the search is over.....forget the overpriced Strip.....best Italian west of New York City!!!!\", \"I'm not too much of an Italian food person, but once in a while I do get a craving. Their Antipasto appetizer was yummy. I just wish there was more cheese offered. \\n\\nTheir chicken marsala is pretty delicious as well. Got a side of mushrooms and mixed some in, since I'm a big mushroom fan, although the side of mushrooms could have been a great side by itself. Great flavor. The meat sauce that came with the baked penne was yummy as well. There really wasn't a lack of flavor on anything. \\n\\nFor dessert, had the cannolis. Great way to end a nice meal. Yes, their meals are by all means not cheap, but you really get a great serving. Plenty of food for leftovers that were equally good the next day. If ever I get the craving for Italian again, I'll visit this place for sure.\", 'On our way home we found this place on yelp. So glad we stopped in. Great food, reasonable, cozy atmosphere, very friendly staff. We will definitely be back here soon!', 'Our new favorite Italian restaurant. Great family restaurant, the staff is friendly and the food is great. They just opened a few weeks ago and they are busy already. I guess word travels fast when there is a new favorite restaurant in your neighborhood.', \"Absolutely amazing!!!! The Italian restaurant in the Golden Nugget has been my favorite for a long time and usually I think no place compares.  I have now found a new favorite!  Don't let this place fool you.  It may be small but the food is so amazing!  You won't be disappointed.  The service was also great.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  We will be going back regularly.\", 'Fantastic find in our neighborhood.   Great service and the food is absolutely over the top.  Love the staff and we highly recommend.   Please support this local restaurant.   Will be back next week', 'This was a wonderful find on our first night in Vegas.  We were on our way to another place and happened upon it in a shopping center.  We were in a mood for pizza and saw the reviews so we decided to try it out.  It was delicious!  Everything from the starter knots and salad to the wonderful pizza and we finished with some yummy cookies.  \\n\\nThe dough of the knots and pizza crust were so perfectly crunchy yet chewy.  The cheese was so delicious I could have just ordered a cheese pizza.  The mushrooms were sauteed before and delicious.\\n\\nI hope we will have another meal while in town to try some other menu items!', \"Nothing but good things about this place! Super cute restaurant perfect for date night or a family get together. Came during the week and got seated right away. Received some fresh bread & olive oil dipping sauce not long after we got seated. \\n\\nFirst off... portions are huge! We started with the Caesar salad which was very fresh & creamy. Would definitely order that again. \\n\\nEntrees we got the basil pesto pasta with vegetables and lasagna. The basil pasta was perfect, not too much oil or cream for the sauce and there was just as much vegetables as there was pasta. The lasagna was also a big heaping portion and could definitely tell was homemade! I was looking forward to my leftovers the next day :)\\n\\nTheir menu was pretty large but I'm excited to go back and try something different... or maybe even try one of their delicious desserts.\", 'I know everyone gave 5 Stars and I am glad you had a great experience with greta food, but we did not nor the table next to us. We want to like this place as the previous Resteraunt was one of our all time favorites.\\nThe owners are very nice and helpful I will give them that. They work the dining room well checking on things. We sat at a middle table looking into the wait station. We sat for 10 minutes before we were told who our server would be but I guess they forgot to tell her. Lots of staff in the dining room running around but no one stopped to check on us for the 10 minutes. When we were approached we ordered an appetizer and a glass of wine and for another 10 minutes no wine to the table as everyone kept working the POS computer for orders. We stopped one of the openers who handled the wine delivery.\\nMozzarella balls were very good and I had the Seafood Pasta which was very good and hot. Wife had the Eggplant park which the outer layer was hot but the interior was ice cold. Not a good fist experience but I hope they will get better and we will try again. They did deduct the eggplant from the final bill which is admirable.\\nWhat I noticed is that there is an over abundance of staff on the floor but all doing different things at the same tables. The Server who delivered the food kept getting the tables wrong or brining the wrong meal to a table. Again I hope that in time they fall into a rhythm.\\nThe table next to us had the same issues with service and order delivery so it was not just us this evening. We did how ever receive a free dessert which was also very good. We will be back and hopefully my next review will be in the 5 star range', 'Great food I had the Veil Parmesan very tasty. I enjoyed the sauce and tenderness of the veil. Also the cheese balls are very good. The minestrone soup very good. I highly recommend this place. Nice atmosphere.', \"We were heartbroken when our favorite small Italian spot closed but now it has been replaced by Trattoria Italia and oh my it is fabulous.  I have now eaten there 3 times and it has been wonderful every time.  The antipasto misto is delicious and freshly prepared.  Their lasagna is great with meat sauce.  Their salads are nice and crisp.  Spaghetti and meatballs was a traditional Italian plate and was delicious.  It's small and adorable with baked goodies galore .\", 'I was in town with my daughters soccer team for a tournament. I called them last min and asked if they could seat out team of 20. They said sure so we headed over. We arrived right about closing time and they had everything ready for us. We choose family style and it was AMAZING. The food was so good! And it was fast to our table.. which the starving soccer team was so thankful for! We had a very long day and this was the perfect ending!', \"Love the casual-ness of the staff. Great service, our server was the chefs wife. Very authentic, amazing food. Can't wait to come back!\", 'Don\\'t walk in at 9:30 because they\\'ll shoo you away and say they\\'re \"closed\" when they actually are supposed to close at 10. I grew up in the restaurant industry and that\\'s not how you run a business.', 'I would find it hard to believe anyone eating at this amazing restaurant would give it anything less then 5 stars. Tonight our group enjoyed a fabulous dinner. We all had something different with dishes from lasagna to lobster ravioli and all in between. No need to go anywhere else to have great italian food.', \"Great first impression of this place. Lobster ravioli with the vodka sauce was amazing, the lasagna was awesome, and the chicken piccata with penne noodles was great. We came with friends who have eaten here before a few times and they said they've never been disappointed with any dish. Service is friendly. We will definitely come back when we're craving authentic Italian food!\", 'Wow Kenny at cvs said try Trattoria for dinner. \\nNice local spot off the strip. He was so right.\\nGreat food, service & atmosphere. Jill & everyone else was fantastic. Thank you for the best dinner of or stay in Vegas.', 'Really nice place and great food. Definitely comfort food! My mom had one of the salads and it looked absolutely stunning! Such FRESH vegetables. My dad and I had some pasta. Excellent! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs some comfort food or a great Italian meal. Well done!', \"I don't know how anyone could give this locally own gem anything other then five stars. The staff is friendly, and the owner is amazing;she makes you feel at home. Not only is the service on point, the food speaks for itself: my favorite is the the lobster linguine which is literally served with a whole lobster, and the tiramisu is out of this world!!\", \"This place is super cute, hugged in between a hair salon and what used to be a chee chee burger on Eastern + 215.\\n\\nWe went mid-day for lunch on a Monday and loved our experience. The food was lovely and our server was nice enough to comp our desserts and affogato for us.\\n\\nI strongly recommend my dish the lobster ravioli over my friend's tricolore gnocchi (and I rarely say that about potato dishes ever) simply because the pink vodka ravioli sauce is to die for! Spongebob and Plankton knew what they were talking about when they said that ravioli secrets were worth fighting for.\\n\\nCautionary tale that their desserts are no joke in size, with cream puffs the size of saucers and truffles richer than Donald Trump. Honestly, it's like these desserts got their degrees and went back for grad school. Then to top off our visit, their affogatos were a great balance of creamy and bitter deliciousness.\\n\\nThere was simply no downside to our visit, I would definitely like to come back soon to try their carvery entrees.\", 'If I were to be in a relationship with carbs, our online status would say \"it\\'s complicated.\" Carbs are great and all, but I tend to make poor choices as to the quantity and frequency in which I indulge. In short, I need to be supervised. Cue Bethany E. She joined me for lunch here at Trattoria Italia to keep my carb intake in check. Long story short: we failed.\\n\\nEGGPLANT RIPIENI: This baked eggplant dish is similar to eggplant parmesan but without the breading of most versions. Vegetable, sauce, and cheese, served bubbling. Goes great with the garlic knots, and the portion is large enough to serve as an entree.\\nMUSHROOM RISOTTO: Special dish of the day but delicious enough to deserve a spot on the menu. Giant portion, saucy and packed with a variety of mushrooms. I couldn\\'t get enough of this. Awesome vegetarian entree, may be even better with chicken. \\nORECCHIETTE: Little ears pasta, my fave. Chewy, tender, tiny pasta pieces. This version is tossed with a light oil, broccoli rabe, and a rave-worthy sausage. This portion was the largest of them all and could easily be split and shared. \\n\\nOur giant lunch was so filling and delicious that only a small late dinner was needed. The hefty portion of leftovers was helpfully escorted to Bethany\\'s home rather than my own. Service was attentive without being intrusive, and location is cozy for a quiet date or ample catch-up conversation with friends. Looking forward to coming back for more!', 'Ambiance is just right. Service is just perfect. They genuinely want you to have a great dining experience. But the food....wow. So very good. From the breadsticks to the penne alla vodka, perfection. Glad to have authentic Italian in the neighborhood. The New Yorker in my house is quite picky. And he was very pleased.', \"This is my new favorite place! I had a last minute birthday dinner with my friends and family here, I called around 5 Pm to make a reservation for 10 at 7 PM and they were super friendly and set it up right away. When we walked in at 7 PM, our spot was ready for us, we didn't have to wait at all. The food here is amazing! Every single dish we ordered was delicious! I've been back at least 3 times after my birthday and the service and food is always on point!\", \"Family owned. Excellent service. Excellent food. Excellent prices. I've had the meatball sub, lasagna, and several desserts; everything has been great. By far the best Italian restaurant in the area.\", 'Beautiful Food Beautiful Wine and Beautiful Experience. I love this place 5 stars all the way', 'Great little Italian restaurant located off of Eastern. We started out with the arinchini which was devine! Most places you get 2 large ones, but here you get five nestled in a plate of marinara sauce. Delish. Next I had the gnocchi with the Ninni sauce and the little lady had chicken parm. Both dishes came out perfect with the chicken parm having a great crust and the cook modifying the dish to meet the request we had. Service was top notch and the prices was appripriate. No down sides at this little gem.', \"Opening day and can't wait to get back! Great owners and staff and most importantly the food was outstanding. We hate being rushed through our meal and hustled out the door and this was just the opposite. A relaxing dinner with fresh authentic food that was prepared when ordered not 3 days ago. We were very disappointed when Montesanos closed but we've found our new favorite place!!!\", 'Great service, great food. Came with my family on Saturday night and was delighted at how attentive the servers were - you could tell they value their customers and try to get to know every one of them on a more personal level AND plus the food was delicious. \\n\\nWe started off with the meatballs Nepoli for our appetizers- absolutely heavenly- the sauce was perfect for dipping the free garlic knots into too! I ate so many of those garlic knots - they came out freshly baked and piping hot. As soon as we ran out of the basket, we were immediately given another basket. \\n\\n\\nIn terms of entrees, I had the lasagna, my brother had the fettuccine Bolognese and my dad had the orecchiette with sausage. All three were great, highly recommend them, especially the orecchiette if you want something a bit different :) \\n\\nWill definitely be back!', 'Almost done right, true Italian style. The bread could be more of a baguette rather than rolls. We ordered the Spaghetti Amatriciana and Lasanga. Both were very freshly cooked but, the recipe lacked true Italian authenticity. (We lived in Italy for 3 years). Our advice, stick with true Italian recipes without adding the American spices and flairs.', \"Good all the way around. Used Yelp to find something in the area we found ourselves in, and wow! We would have settle for a disappointment just to quickly find something to eat, but we really scored!\\nI had the baked penne with marinara bolognese sauce, which is one of the best I have eating in a resturant. \\n\\nEven if you are just kinda feeling like Italian, don't think, just head over.\", '2nd visit and will be back! The food was fantastic and the service phenomenal! Highly recommended!', \"In a word, EXCELLENT!  Great food, service, ambiance, portion sizes and price.  Can't ask for more!\", 'Very authentic Italian Trattoria.  My father is law is Italian and knows his food.  He was speaking to the entire waitstaff in Italian and was laughing the whole time.  He was very impressed with everything except the Osso Bucco which he rates as average.  Family owned and run.  A great neighborhood find.  We will ba back many times I am sure.', \"I can't figure out how this place could ever get anything less than 5 stars!\\nThe owners and servers are wonderful!\\nThe servers are attentive and we never had to wait for drinks or our next course.\\nThe food is unbelievable so delicious.\\nOur new favorite Italian restaurant!\\nEven as it became busy and crowded the service remained consistent.\", 'Enjoyed this place very much. My family is from Sicily and it is hard to find the really stuff. Well this place has the really stuff. Food was good they have Italian cookies, pastries, and the best cannoli you could have. You need to try this place. I will be back again. Loved the Italian music also', 'Attention my Italian friends!! This is the relationship deal of Tattorias. This quaint and softly decorated restaurant reminds you of Italy...equipped with a Chef who was born and raised there!  Tasteful and polite service!  The bowl of minestrone soup is spot on and comes with small sized garlic knots. Caparese salad had large sized slices covered with balsamic vinegar.  All deserts are baked fresh daily. I recommend you try the cuchidati cookies...OMG...real real real Italian\\nCookies.', 'We got a pepperoni pizza about two months ago. It was doughy in the middle. I understand that the pepperoni tends to be greasy but it wasn\\'t that, it was doughy. So, a few weeks ago we decided to try it again because the taste was very good. When I called to order I let the guy know the last one was doughy, and he said \"so you would like your pizza\"......paused...so I said \"cooked\". Got there to pick it up and was told it was still in the oven because I wanted it well done. Got home and looked more cooked around the edges but the dough in the middle was a soggy mess and disintegrated. It was a mess but again, the flavor was good. Really wish they would figure out the dough issue.', 'Very yummy! Nice authentic atmosphere. My pregnant self was craving pasta and I wanted to try this place. We came on a Saturday night; it was a little busy but they accommodated us right away. My husband ordered a Caesar salad and the farfalle al salmone. I had the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. Both dishes were delicious! The owner came by after our dinner to ask us if everything went well. He was very nice and courteous.', 'Ate here the other night with family and it was great. Everything we had was delicious. We started with some appetizers. Calamari was one of the best calamari dishes I have had. Caprese Salad, the addition of salad to this is a perfect touch. The best appetizer we had was the eggplant. Mouth watering! Our entrees did not disappoint either. We ordered the chicken parmigiana, cannelloni, linguine pesto and a pepperoni pizza. We will definitely be back.', \"What a great place. So happy to see the owners of a previous restaurant in Southern Highlands here. The food is amazing and matches the service and quality of food. You get that family feel and atmosphere along with authentic Italian specialties. Can't wait to go back.\", \"This restaurant has fantastic, authentic Italian food, great vibe, and wonderful service at a very fair price. My husband is Italian and was very glad to find Trattoria Italia as he is often craving the food and ambiance from home and after several years living here in the states he has finally found just that!! We have had their pizza, aranchini, Canoli, and cassata Siciliana...all were fantastic! If you're looking for a great Italian place to eat here in Vegas, I highly recommend Trattoria Italia!!\", \"Finally a good real Italian restaurant in Las Vegas! I was born and raised in Italy so I'm very picky when it comes to Italian food, and I can honestly say that Trattoria Italiana is my favorite Italian restaurant. It's family owned and that gives that personal touch that you can't find in the chain restaurants; I met Milena, her husband Ninni, her brother Pasquale, her son Giovanni, Laura the waitress, and they were all so nice to me and my family! I like the atmosphere because it feels like being in a real Italian trattoria, I like the table clothes on the tables (typical in Italian restaurants but not here in the states), the bread is phenomenal, they make it with pizza dough and it's still warm when they bring it to the table, and the list goes on. I and my family will definitely go back to Trattoria Italiana!  \\n\\nWe went there again for my husband's birthday the other day and we both had pizza: it was really good and I'm going to post pictures so you can see what I'm talking about!\", 'While overnighting in Vegas, my wife said, \"Let\\'s find a good Italian eatery.\"  We did.  Trattoria Italia was excellent!  We started with Caprese.  My wife had Penne Arrabbiata -- \"perfectly spicy\" is how she described this dish.  I had Linguine Pesto w/chicken.   We finished the meal off with 2 Cannoli -- we were told \"dad\" made them ... whoever did, yum!  In past visits to Vegas, we would frequent a chain restaurant.  No more!', 'Amazing dinner and ambiance! It feels like visiting family here, and we are treated as such! Grazie mille !!!', 'Great traditional pasta. Best spot I have been to since eating pasta in Italy. Would go there again and again. This is a family owned restaurant and service is always great.', \"Amazing food and great people.  A family owned and operated place with owners and family from Italy. It's hard to get more authentic than that. All of the sauces are made fresh daily from authentic Italian recipes. The desserts are made every morning by an Italian pastry chef. The cannoli was the best I've ever had. The lobster ravioli was amazing, with huge pieces of lobster. We drove clear across town to eat here and it was totally worth it.\", \"I had mixed feelings about this new Italian spot. I came in wanting to like this place and the experience started out well. Pros are that there is plenty of parking, menu prices are reasonable, and I enjoyed my meal. Cons are that they are new so there are service kinks to work out and the sweets were not good.\\n\\nOn a Sunday evening my husband and I were looking for a casual Italian spot to grab dinner. Service started out great with a prompt seating even though they were busy. Our waitress greeted us quickly, drink orders were taken, and rolls were served. \\n\\nThe rolls to start were okay. I enjoyed them, but it wasn't like bread at other restaurants that draws me back in. I also had a glass of the house Muscato. Nice flavor, but it had a carbonated texture that turned me off a bit.\\n\\nChicken Marsala with a side of pasta was calling my name. It was a large serving that included two pieces of chicken. The portion was perfect since I wanted to save half for my lunch the next day. I really enjoyed the Chicken Marsala and would order this dish again. My side of Sautéed Spinach was loaded with garlic and delicious as well. My husband had Ravioli and said it compared to the canned version kids love. He said he would never return here based on his dish. \\n\\nThe waitress that had been friendly and attentive went MIA around the time the check should have arrived. By the time the check finally showed up I was armed with credit card to speed up the process, but she dropped and ran. Thus began the long wait for her to return to get the card and close us out. \\n\\nWhile that wait began I went to the dessert counter to get goodies to go. It took an unreasonable amount of time to even get the owner to acknowledge my presence. Since they were busy I started out patient, but it ended up being excessive. He finally acknowledged me, but then the phone rang and he asked if he could grab it. I run into the same situation at my job so I was understanding and said it was fine, but then he didn't come back to me after the call. He wandered away and the process began again. I should have taken this as a sign, but I waited and ordered four desserts. \\n\\nThe desserts looked great in the case, but three of the four ended up in the trash. I'm a huge sweets person, but these were just a waste of calories. Texture and taste were all wrong on three of the four. The fourth I ate just out of confusion that it could really be so flavorless. \\n\\nOverall, my meal was pretty good and the pricing was low compared to other Italian options in the area. I also like that the restaurant is casual making it a good option for families or nights where dressing up just isn't enticing. The bad service and bad sweets ruled this out for future dining out experiences, but I would consider them for take-out in the future.\", \"Among the best Italian food not only in Vegas, but amongst the best I've eaten anywhere! Wish I could give 10 stars.\", 'Traditional yet not pretentious. The chef/owner from Spagetty Western newest Italian creation does not disappoint. Order the Arancini. Delightful people and food. My heart (and stomach) are full today.', \"Absolutely fantastic True Italian Restaurant. This place is in the same spot where Montasantos use to be. My daughter and I walked in and had dinner, she ordered the Spaghetti Aglio' Oglio and I have the Eggplant Parmigiano and both dishes were full of taste and quality. The sauce was perfect and not NY Italian style but real Italian. The Aglio' Oglio was exactly like my mother made it. I am highly recommending Trattoria Italia! The desserts are made fresh on the premises and the service was stellar! They will be expanding soon, blowing out the walls and taking over next door making it a banquet room for catered events. Run don't walk there, you will be so happy.\", \"After finding this restaurant on yelp with great reviews, my husband and I decide to stop in for lunch. Let me start off by saying, the food is great. We ordered the baked pasta and a Cesar salad. Now the downfall. This is the first Italian restaurant, that didn't order bread when first sitting down. Originally our order included the bowl of the minestrone. We let the guy who took our order that we would like our salad and soup before the pasta. At least 15 minutes go by and here comes our baked pasta which was great cause it came out so fast, but we never got our salad and soup. The lady who brought out the pasta said she would check on it. She took our pasta away and then the guy who had taken our order came out and apologized for the mix up and then told me that they didn't have any minestrone soup. 20 minutes now after we put in our original order, you just now tell us you don't have something we had order. Long story short, the food was great. The service was horrible!! Definitely will not be going back here just because the service was so bad!! It's really to bad cause we really enjoyed the food!\", 'Reasonably priced for great food. Great atmosphere, besides soccer playing on tv in background.', \"This place is a must check out if you haven't already! My grandma had taken my mom here for dinner recently and they both were talking about how great it was. It's super close to my house so one night my mom decided she wanted to take my husband and I here for dinner and chose this place. It was terrific! The staff was very friendly and the place is put together very well. We all enjoyed our delicious dinner and even had a ton of food leftover to take home. My mom ordered a huge house salad and their house wine, my husband ordered the pesto gnocchi , and I ordered a penne pasta with marinara for my daughter and I. Everything was extraordinary! I'm craving their food now as I type this! A must check out if you haven't already! Can't wait to go back again soon!!\", \"Today was National Meatball Day and we thought we would try the neighborhood family owned Italian restaurant! Absolutely fantastic food and service. The Insalada Italiania was more than enough for two and was very fresh. Spaghetti and meatballs were prepared to perfection.  Again, the portions were most generous! Our server, Jill, was most attentive and helpful. One of the owners, Pasquale, visited our table to make certain we were pleased with our meal! We were definitely pleased and assured him we will be returning and telling others about this wonderful treasure. Prices were moderate for the high quality of food and service.  You will be missing out if you don't try this gem.  Reservations recommended Friday and Saturday.\", \"This is the new Italian restaurant that moved into the old montessano's space on eastern Ave in Henderson. \\nWe had spaghetti and meatballs and chicken parm. \\nEverything was excellent. It's a family owned business and the owner came over to welcome us. Everyone was very nice and welcoming. They are still getting settled in and with every new place there's a a learning curve, (just a few days since they opened) but first and foremost there spaghetti sauce is excellent !  We're looking forward to trying all their dishes.  Almost forgot...Their cannoli was very good as well !\", \"Went there Sat. eve for dinner.  I had the Lasagna, my wife had a dish:  pasta stuffed with angel hair and eggplant.  Our son had the Alfredo Fetticini (Sp.?).  Everyone Loved everything.  Wife's dish was out of sight.

We went to this restaurant, thinking that it was the previous restaurant there, but it was a new eatery. We decided to try it anyway. They seated us immediately, which was amazing considering how many larger parties were waiting to be seated. We were a party of 2. We were seated at a very small table in the very back, and literally squeezed in. It's as if they found out the max seating they could get by with and stuffed tables in. I'd recommend they take out 2 small tables for 2 in that back area, along with a table for 4 in the other, larger, seating area. They've crammed too many tables in the eatery...and if you aren't comfortable sitting there, then why even go eat there? Let's put it this way: They had to ask the other small table of 2 to get up so they could serve us our food. We were that packed in. The food was okay. What we both had was bland. It just needed more seasoning. The service was really great. And I mean that. I think the staff really work very hard. I wish I could give them 3 stars based on that, but the experience was not that good. They even gave us a free dessert to go, which was fantastic.\\n\\nThis is a new location for this restaurant, so maybe they'll refine the number of tables and add a bit more seasoning to their food. They certainly had a great number of people waiting to eat there, so they have a good following. I wish them the very best.\", \"My Italian dining curse has broken!\\n\\nTrattoria Italia is located in the location formerly Montesano's.  Its easily spotted from Eastern with plenty of parking.  Going with a fellow Yelper Stefany means I'll be trying more than one thing.  I always say yes to that!\\n\\nWe decided to start with the Eggplant Ripieni.  Great decision on Stefany's part.  It's a bubbling baked dish resting in sauce and covered in cheese.  The sauce is flavorful and goes well with the complimentary garlic knot basket.  This appetizer is fantastic! \\n\\nFor the main attractions we split the special of the day Mushroom risotto and the Orecchiette. The mushroom risotto is incredible.  The huge dish of risotto was creamy and delectable.  I didn't want to stop eating.   But since we had another entree so I had to.  \\n\\nThe Orecchiette is served with broccoli rabe and sausage.  The buttery pasta was combined with plenty of sausage and broccoli.  Again this was a giant dish of food.  We had plenty to take home for a second meal.  \\n\\nDessert? They have a case at the entrance filled with plenty of tasty treats.  I was feeling quite full but couldn't say no to a cannoli.  But instead of the large I went with a mini cannoli.  The cannoli is fresh and indulgent.  The shell was crisp with no sogginess.  Yum! \\n\\nTo top off the amazing food, we had wonderfully attentive service.  She was good about keeping up with our water intake.  It was a great experience and I hope to be back soon for more!\", 'The carbonara brought me to tears. It is that good.

It's a comfortable, very clean, relaxed atmosphere.  This was our first visit, but it has now become our go-to place for Italian cooking.\", \"Recently visited Trattoriia Italia on a vacation to Vegas, and we will definitely be back. For an appetizer we order the fried mozzarella balls, how can you go wrong with fried cheese! The tomato sauce for dipping was so delicious. Our entrees were gnocchi and fettuccine alfredo. The gnocchi was soft and delicious, it came with a trio of sauces, the pesto was by far my favorite. My son had the fettuccine and all but licked the bowl, and this boy's a pasta expert! The best part of the meal was the incredible tiramisu. Our server told us that the owner's dad makes it fresh every morning, and you could tell. It was creamy and so very rich and delicious. Save room for dessert!!! The servers were kind, knowledgeable and made us feel welcome. Can't wait to return!\", \"I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo & the Calamari Taormina.  The fettuccine was cooked perfectly, but the alfredo sauce was lacking in flavor.  I even tried to dress it up w/ Parmesan cheese & additional spices, but that didn't help.  The shrimp & calamari in the Calamari Taormina were overcooked & the zucchini was so scarce that it shouldn't even be mentioned in the description.  The garlic knots were the best part of the meal.\\n\\nI ordered the items for delivery through Grubhub.  Not sure if that made an impact on the quality.\", 'Went to this restaurant with my girlfriend. We ordered the Italian salad to start and it was very good.  Bread was super doughy with no flavor. Put some garlic on that shit.\\n\\nShe ordered the gnocchi which was okay. When I ordered the Mediterranean linguine which is supposed to be scallops and shrimp in a light cream red sauce, I had asked the waited if the seafood was fresh or frozen. \\n\\nHis response was \"yes they are fresh...as fresh as they can be, cause we are in vegas\". To which I replied, \"what?\"\\n\\nHe replied \"yes, they are fresh\"\\n\\nLater he came back and said they were out of scallops. Suspect sir.\\n\\nHe offered some alternatives to which I proceeded to order mussels in place of the scallops. \\n\\nWhen I tasted both the shrimp and mussels they were both obviously from frozen. If not they were cooked suspiciously. The sauce was like hot red milk with no flavor. \\n\\nOverall, suspect. For $24, that seafood pasta should be fresh or cooked better.\\n\\nThe waiter also mentioned that the Mediterranean linguine was one of their most popular items. \\n\\nYou\\'re suspect trattoria italia.', 'Great find... one of my good friends took me here... food was outstanding with reasonable prices and portions.  Chianti was excellent and fairly priced.  Definitely going to be one of my go to places from now on!', \"This place is authentic... to a point where some staff only speak Italian.  Everything is made in house, it's a family business.  So everyone takes part, even the father of the owner makes the pastries, and let me just say... best cannoli!  And those cookies? Absolutely fabulous.  It's a bit pricy but personally you're paying for quality Italian food, with a sweet bistro ambiance.  I loved it, and honestly haven't experience authentic Italian in a long time.  I'm so happy to know this place exists in the world!\", 'Vastly overrated.....\\n\\n1. The food was marginal - soups lacked flavor and any sort of presentation. The entrees were acceptable, but nothing to rave about. \\n\\n2. Lighting is 2X  brighter than it should be. \\n\\n3. Music was a mix of Christmas songs and hip-hop.....are you kidding me? \\n\\n4. Our server would rate somewhere between \"bland\" and \"cold\". \\n\\n5. The owner stood literally 1 foot to my left talking to the other table for at least 10 to 15 minutes. This was highly annoying - and not to mention, intrusive. \\n \\n** The place is \"new\" - I guess.... That is really all it has going for it. Location probably does not hurt either, so people might \"fall\" for it. \\n\\nWill likely never return - \\n\\nOverall score:  3.5/10', 'This is one of those hidden gems in town.  Everything about this place was amazing.  The service was great and the server was really nice. He helped us ordered by telling us what was his favorite.  I had the gnocchi with their vodka sauce. It was amazing.  My friend and I also shared their meatballs. Do not skip out on the meatballs they are really really tasty.  Overall this place is amazing and I will be bringing alot of my friends back.  A truly hidden gem.', \"I work at a upscale Italian restaurant at the Venetian and have been looking for closer Italian food, hopefully for cheaper, with similar taste and quality. Not anything like Olive Garden or Carrabas- ew. I just saw this place on my drive home, stopped and ordered a spaghetti amatriciana Togo. Still as hot as if it just left the kitchen, I'm eating this now at my house (10 mins after picking it up) and it is JUST what I was looking for. This is a fantastic dish. Delicious, hot, fresh, worth the price. I dare say it equals the $30 spaghetti amatriciana at my work. The garlic knots weren't anything spectacular but it's a free addition so who cares. I'm so happy I found this and can't wait to try everything else on the menu!\", \"This is my new spot! I'm Sicilian and very picky. The food is fabulous! The four of us all tried something different and we were all delighted with our selections! The service was warm and friendly. Such a great experience I can't wait to come back!\", \"Stopped by tonight after the wait for BJ's was almost an hour. Saw that this was a new place, so decided to try it out!\\n\\nFirst, was served cold tap water. Bleh. Vegas water is gross lol We were greeted by a very nice server (I wish I had taken down her name!) After hearing the specials, I ordered the eggplant parm, my husband ordered the chicken parm, and my little one got spaghetti. \\n\\nMy little one wanted my angel hair pasta that came with mine instead of her own spaghetti, so I got to eat her meatballs. Yum! The eggplant parm was really yummy! My husband said his chicken parm was really good too. \\n\\nFor desert, I had an almond cookie, my husband had a canolli, and the baby had an almond desert with a cherry on top. All were really good! \\n\\nOnly complaint I have is that the kids meals are way overpriced. $8 for spaghetti is crazy.\", 'Went in tonight for the very first time. \\nAMAZING!!!  Beats Carrabas, beats Brio and beats several casino places. \\nHad Linguine Pesto with chicken and it blew my socks off.  My wife had Chicken Scaloppini and loved her food.  Nice cab table wine.  Made fresh bread with a garlic oil to dip into.  \\nGreat owners and people there.\\nWILL BE BACK NEXT WEEK!!!', 'We came in quite late on a Saturday after a day in the hot Las Vegas sun - 30 minutes before closing.  The staff made us feel right at home, regardless, even delivering an amazing desert and singing happy birthday to our teenage daughter.  The waitress was kind and understanding of our picky eater, vegan, and mom with seafood, nut, and dairy allergies.  We felt safe and understood.  The even have gluten-free options!!! We highly recommend.', 'Totally amazing. We split a flavorful Italian salad that was dressed perfectly, loaded with olives, marinated roasted red peppers, mozzarella and artichokes. The entrees we chose were gnocchi ninni, chicken piccata, chicken Parmesan sandwich and orecchiette in a garlic oil with sausage and broccoli rabe.\\n\\nMy gnocchi came from heaven right into my plate. The sauce was a marscapone base with roasted red peppers, garlic and spinach. Creamy, dreamy, plenty to take home. \\n\\nMost remarkable is the service, a family that made us feel like family. And the prices make this one of the TOP VALUES around. Grazie, Trattoria Italia, until the next time!', \"Stopped in for lunch on a Friday afternoon after reading yelp reviews. We were the only table but the server said they are much busier for dinner. We ordered the soup and the chicken parmigiana. The soup was very watery and had very little flavor. The chicken parmigiana was good. They were nice enough to split it on two plates for us. Overall it was ok but not sure we'd go back.\", \"Amazing food amazing atmosphere great service gorgeous place...you feel like you're in Italy...\", \"We went here looking for some homemade Italian food like someone's Italian grandma would make.Like some amazing sauce and flavorful food.Based on the reviews our expectations were big! Disappointing to say the least.My wife ordered the Chicken Marsala which consisted of 2 thin and flavorless pieces of chicken with mushrooms that she thought might be canned.Sent that back and got the Eggplant parm which was a little better after she requested more sauce for it.I had the Lasagna and it was terrible.With several other authentic Italian restaurants in the area,we won't be back.Our waitress was attentive and helpful though.Comfy atmosphere in a small strip mall on Eastern.\", 'They have turned this place around! Quality food. Welcoming and hospitable hosts and servers. Had pizza and salad and were treated like we were spending a zillion dollars; they treat everyone nicely.\\n\\nBaked goods are outstanding. All freshly made. Cookies, pastries to eat there or take away. Split a freshly made connolli that was excellent. This place is on our list for frequent return visits.', 'Food was good but not great.  I would give them another chance.  Interior decor was nice and homey.', 'Always excellent service from Jill and all the staff. Outstanding food. Love the eggplant parm and the veal parm. Huge and delicious meatballs. Oversize portions make perfect lunch the next day. Make reservations!', \"If you haven't tried Trattoria Italia yet, gooooo! We've been here a handful of times and each time, the food was excellent. They can get pretty busy, but service is still great and they have a tempting dessert display at the front counter - definitely worth grabbing a few things on the way out.\\n\\nI love a good calamari and theirs doesn't disappoint. The insalata is delish and so filling - greens, roasted peppers, artichoke hearts, tomatoes and mozzarella. I'm getting hungry just writing this review! The fettuccini bolognese tastes like the sauce has been simmering on the stove all day and the lasagna is flavorful without being too rich or cheesy.\\n\\nThey take reservations so be sure to call ahead!\", \"I was actually starting to like this place. But this is what happened, so I go in and I order the baked cannelloni. The gentleman I gave my order to I think is either the manager or the owner he's the bald headed guy. So I get my food and then after I'm about a third into my food he brings over my bread which I thought was a little late I mentioned it to him and he did not respond. I think maybe if he wasn't on his stupid computer I would have got better service. The food here is very good but that was very disappointing. And the little bread knots that he gave me were stale. One time before I did order dessert to go and I was going to let it slide but that too was stale I think it's been sitting in the glass case for way too long. Too many Italian restaurants in this town not going to go back.\", 'Family owned and operated restaurant with a very homelike feel. Food was amazing and service was even better! We will be back many more times!', \"The food is fresh and so good. Our family loves coming here. We went to the owner's previous restaurant for years and gladly followed them over here. The food is better than ever and they have great desserts. \\nWe love the family feel every time we walk in the door and the friendly staff. Highly recommend coming here when you can. Some of our favorites are the misto appetizer, chicken parm sandwich, gnocchi with pesto, and cannoli along side out cappuccino.\", \"Unplanned visit and so glad we did! Service is great. A casual place yet food quality is excellent. I'd highly recommend this to friends that work or live in this area. I'm coming back for sure.\", 'Excellent food. Congenial owners. Pasta fagioli to die for. Definitely will come back soon.', \"Ordered online through Grubhub for delivery.  Ordered eggplant parmigiana with sauce on side.  Received order with no sauce at all.  Also ordered linguine with clam sauce .  All the clam shells were broken and I was picking out sharp pieces while trying to chew. Called owner and he was rude.  Said you want sauce you come get.  This place is recently opened and we won't be ordering again.\", 'This Italion restaurant is outstanding. Lasagne was brought to our table and the sauce was still boiling. The owners used to have a restaurant in southern highlands and when they moved the food was not as good. Once we found them, we have started going back and have not been disappointed. My friend had questions on the wine- no problem. He was allowed to sample each and then made his order. They go out of their way to make eating there a good experience', 'soooo.. we really liked this place (as u can see from our previous review) until today.  called in ahead and ordered two salads for pick up for lunch, \\n1 caesar salad        $9.00\\n1 antipasto misto  $13.00\\n\\nwe got home and immediately started eating. upon tasting the caesar dressing, i noticed it had no flavor whatsoever. it tasted like flour mixed w/water... it was weird.  we called and very politely let the woman on the phone know that they may want to taste the dressing as it was completely flavorless.  we have caesar dressing here at home so this wouldnt have been a big deal, if her response wouldve been appropriate... she acted like we were bothering her by calling!!! like we got it for free or something!!! she could not care less .. no apology, no \"hey, thx for lettn us kno!\", nothing. just \"ok\", \"ok\", \"ok\", bye!!?  \\n\\nbleh... its pretty hard to screw up salads.. but they did.  $28 worth of wilted, old lettuce and flavorless white gravy!!! lol\\n\\nnever again. theres way too many places in this city to choose from.', 'Man o man. This place is on fire  best Italian food in Nevada. Must come and try. Friendly staff great food.', 'Gnocchi sauce was comparable to Ragu/Chef Boyardee. \\nOverall very good though, the marina sauce they use for the apps was delicious but for some reason it was a very different sauce used for gnocchi', 'If you woke up here you would swear you were in Italy! A nice family run trattoria where everyone speaks Italian and makes you feel at home, very authentic. \\n\\nWe were greeted by the owners daughter, and served by her husband and brother. Bread rolls and water were brought while we looked at the menu. They also have several wines from Italy and Sicily by the glass which is nice. \\n\\nWe started with the pasta e fagioli soup which was delicious. A large bowl filled with cannellini beans, pasta and chunks of pancetta. A 5 star soup! \\n\\nFor our entrees we ordered the eggplant parmesan and the gnocchi with pesto and gorgonzola which is made in house. The waiter asked if we wanted a salad and I asked if they had a SMALL side salad. He said yes. A few minutes later a HUGE salad was brought out that could have easily fed 4 people. It was loaded with roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, buffalo mozzarella, olives, tomato and red onion. Although it was very good, I was a little upset I was brought a $9 dinner salad when I asked for a small side salad. A misunderstanding? I hope so. \\n\\nThe entrees came out and both were very large portions. You definitely get your moneys worth here, as well as leftovers for lunch the next day :)  The eggplant parm was big and covered in cheese. Served with a  side of spaghetti there was plenty to take home. The gnocchi were also very good, melted in my mouth. The sauce was very heavy and very rich, I could barely finish half of it. \\n\\nThe atmosphere here is genuine Italian Trattoria and with all of the friendly staff speaking Italian it is really an authentic experience.', \"My Family brought me here for my birthday last night and we are ALL Italian and must say the Food was Amazing! I COUKDNT decide between  lobster r aviloi and Chicken pucatta so the Awesome waitress said since it's your birthday I will give you some lobster ravioli  instead of Angel hair pasta! How Sweet. The little bread knots are Awesome.. The service is impeccable and then out of Nowhere come these 2 AMAZING snowballs for dessert.. 1 coffee and 1 strawberry.. and they had trick candles!

Food & Service top class.   Must go place .... reasonable priced, big quantities & good friendly staff\\n\\nWill have to come back  to try other items on the menu.', 'The best Italian restaurant we have tried. Authentic food that suits any taste buds. Quantities are ample and a dish will easily service two. Tiramisu we had there is the best ever. Will go to Vegas just to visit the restaurant again!.\\n\\nAmple parking, family friendly and wonderful wait staff.\\n\\nAlso, they have a big selection of desserts at the counter and seemed to be doing brisk business.', \"I live in NYC and visit my parents in Henderson often always disappointed with the food out here. It's far from what I'm used to in NYC. We tried Trattoria Italia and it is AMAZING! Friendly, delicious, and reminded me of home. If you want nyc style Italian food in a casual environment... eat here! Love it! Will return often.\", \"Let me put it this way: if Trattoria Italia's Lobster Ravoli wasn't soooo incredibly good, this place would be a one star joint. \\n\\nTo begin with, most food comes out way under salted and under seasoned. Very bland. If you send it back it comes out just fine the second time around, but when sending food back just to achieve flavor becomes their M.O., something isn't right. \\n\\nPositives: pizza is good, cioppino is good, and lobster ravioli is great. \\n\\nNegatives: food is very under flavored, service at the front is very pushy. Prices are too high for what you're getting. Oh, and their caprese salad has microscopic amounts of basil, and a copious amount of spinach and lettuce. Seriously?! I didn't order a house salad with tomato and mozzarella. \\n\\nAs for the staff, I've just come across much more accommodating staff elsewhere. Customer service and family atmosphere is definitely lost in this dive.\\n\\nPutting aside all biases from my former love of Montesano's, it really is not the best restaurant around. So many other places I will go to in the future besides trattoria.\\n\\nWould I recommend this place to others? Absolutely not.\\n\\nWould I come back here myself? Only for the lobster ravioli.\", 'Great food and great people. Gelato was amazing!!!! Also the cheese balls are to die for.', 'First off, the store itself is slightly hard to find. But it was truly a fantastic meal. Milena was able to welcome us and make us feel at home.  She offered great suggestions. The appetizers were great. Get the Arancini, for they were the biggest surprise.  Fantastic texture and taste. Her brother, Pasquale, kept our table and our food moving. Will be back sopn.', 'Me and my family. Especially the star Lori Mazza, we are at this restaurant. It was good and excellent. Changed my life. Service and quality of the food is unmatched. Thank you for this life change. I recommend everybody to come in.', 'Nice place and the two folks who were working were nice as well.  We got 3 cokes, a 16 inch pizza, meatball sandwich and a kids spaghetti, with tax we spent $43.30.  Not cheap but authentic and very good.  Kids liked it and so did mom and dad.  I would go back for sure and next time get dessert, they had a ton of choices.', \"The food was ok. Not great. Service was awful!! Our server did not offer us drinks. Came up asked if we wanted to order. We did and he walked away before we could ask for drinks. I tried to continually flag him for a drink order. I finally got his attention. There was a gnat or something in my drink. Never got it replaced. My husband and daughter never got a refill. The server ignored us. Then a family of 7 came in and he gave them water. Took drink orders and told them specials. We didn't know there were specials. And during this time we were one of two tables until the daily of 7 came in. Service was just plain bad\", 'I tried the sea food pasta from this place and it was really good. The other pasta, the one with the mushroom sauce was not too good though. Overall it was good. I really enjoy their olive oil mixture for the bread.', \"Went there tonight for the first time for my little girl's birthday (she loves Italian food).

I'll be back though, hopefully with a clean fork next time.\", 'Just had dinner at this spot. Our server Danny was awesome at recommending dinner options.

Atmosphere, service fabulous!  Spaghetti aglio olio OMGSH and the chicken parm  was huge and so yummy. Tiramisu is best I've ever had... very authentic!! Obviously family owned.

I was hesitant on writing a review for here because I love the feeling of it being a small hidden gem but that's just selfish so here is my review: \\n\\nThe party I was with ordered the Chicken Alfredo, Spaghetti with meatballs, chicken caprese and garlic knots. Everything we ordered was delicious, you could tell the sauces were home made because of how good and flavorful it was. The bread was so good I could only imagine it was made from scratch. The environment was also very enjoyable, the waiters were all very friendly and helpful. Such a great place I will definitely be going back for either date nights or with the whole family.\"]\n",

The owner came out and talked to us. I highly recommend this place.\", 'Excellent thai food. We ordered chicken satay, fish cakes. Fish cakes could have been less oily though. We ordered chicken panang and mint meat for our entree. Excellent. Right quantity, right flavour. I could not find anything wrong in the dish. The owner Ken is a young humble guy and his restaurant  should do well with the good food, service and prices he is offering.', \"Authentic Thai food!!! \\nWe tried this restaurant with a great Groupon deal and so glad we did! It's now one of our favorite restaurants! We ordered eggrolls, larb, crab curry, basil beef,  chicken pad see ew, and thai tea, all were delicious. We liked it best because it wasn't over powering with fish sauce on everything. \\nThe service was great the lady that helped us was nice and very accommodating. I highly recommend coming here and we'll definitely be going back!\", \"Wanted to have Thai tonight with our friends to celebrate a birthday and the choices were Lucki Thai, Table Thai and Bistro and Kinthai!  Since some of us had been to Lucki and to Table Thai, we decided on Kinthai as a new experience to all.\\n\\nLocation - East Sahara and Valley View, about one block past Weera Thai.  Some decent parking. Always an interesting area, that East Sahara strip malls.\\n\\nThe Restaurant - Nicely decorated, about 10 booths and about 5-6 tables. Spacious and plenty of room.  They can accommodate groups of most size and if you have a large group, it can be quite good for that!\\n\\nThe Service - Seems family owned.  The owner or gentlemen that comes out to greet you seems to be very concerned about quality and style of his restaurant.  We were well into our conversation with our friends, so I did not engage with the owner as I normally would.  He came by several times to check on us, and that was great. We just did not speak too much with him as we were catching up with friends.\\n\\nThe Food -\\n\\nTom Yum Chicken - Spice 5.  I wanted to go higher, to 7 or 8 but we had a mixed crowd.  All the soups seem to have a shrimp base, and one of our friends cannot eat shellfish.  However, my wife who doesn't like spice at all thought the soup was the best compared to her other favorite places. I thought that the soup had the right amount of kick to at least feel the heat and so i was happy.  Very excellent soup, comes out in a metal soup hotpot with the flames blasting through the top. Just the way i like it.\\n\\nPad Kee Mao - This was good but hardly spicy.  Normally a spicy dish itself, due to most of our friends not wanting spice, we ordered this at a level 2 spice out of 10 and it was good, just that I needed a bit of a kick in the spice and didn't feel it.  We had this with beef and the beef was tender. The noodles were good, but a bit clumped together.\\n\\nMassaman Curry - With Chicken, spice level 2, good, rich creamy yellow curry with peanut, I thought it was very good overall.\\n\\nBasil - With ground pork. again spice level 2.  Good overall, lots of meat, not too much basil.   I would order again or ask more questions like if they have eggplant and such.\\n\\nSteamed Whole Fish - Not bad, liked the fish, bones and head came off quite easy and everyone enjoyed it. I tend to like steamed fish to be very juicy with lots of juice, soy sauce a bit of oil.  This was  a bit drier than I am used to but I did like it overall and I really enjoyed the amount of ginger they give you.  Of course I prepped the serving by deboning the fish and removing the head and I used my plate for all this so I can clean up the bones and the head of the meat which to me is the best part!\\n\\nLoved the attention, enjoyed the menu, the ambiance, the flavors. Totally enjoyed the soup.  Would it be my most favorite Thai place? That will depend because tonight, we are going to Lucki Thai and will let you know!\", \"This review is for 3.5 stars.\\n\\nNothing bad to say about Kinthai, I just have to compare it with the plethora of other Thai restaurants in the city and it wasn't in my top 5.  \\n\\nMy meal was tasty, spicy, and very fairly priced.  I had the stir fry with pork and the larb salad.  I got mine extra spicy, and it sure was.  They do a 1-10 sliding scale; I got an 8 and it was an eye rinser - delicious and deadly.  The outside and the mall outlet it's in are a little run down, but the restaurant itself is very nice and comely.  \\n\\nKinthai is a solid option if on this part of town.  They have a great $7 lunch special which I would recommend, actually.  But in a town full of outstanding Thai restaurants, I'm going to play the field.\", 'Great Thai food.. Ken the owner is kind.. Great food with a great atmosphere.. Very reasonable priced', \"Hands down some of the best Thai food I've ever had. \\n\\nSuper clean restaurant, great theming, super nice staff, and AMAZING food. \\n\\nI recommend the Panang Chicken. Great portion size and superb flavors. \\n\\nKen the owner personally introduced himself and welcomed us. He also told us about how he follows traditional recipes from Thailand. \\n\\nOverall, best Thai food I've had in Vegas. Can't wait to come back!\", \"Great service and great food!

We ordered: Fish Cakes, Basil Meat, Massaman chicken curry are good and we also ordered the Shrimp Padthai (Just ok).\\n \\nThe Basil meat and Massaman chicken curry comes with a bowl of white rice each and if u switch the white rice to brown rice there is an extra $2 (just a friendly reminder not list it on the menu)!\\n\\nOverall food are good and service are great with that said we will be back & DON'T LET THE OUTSIDE FOOL YOU INSIDE THE RESTAURANT IS NICE\", \"Only complaint is that it's far from where I live! Food was amazing and really good portions. Thai food is my favorite so I'm extremely picky but this place was beyond amazing! Oh and did I mention suuuuuper good prices! Definitely a must if you like Thai food :D\", \"Probably the best Thai I've had!...And there is a Groupon for it.My new fave place for dinner.Dont let the bad strip Mall put you off....\", 'Highly recommend this place! The food is very impressive and the service is amazingly awesome! I would definitely come back here and invite all friends and family members.', \"Very tasty.  Pad Thai is good.  Tom kha soup has excellent flavor.  Red curry was also tasty.  Dinner portions are generous.  Service was good - very friendly and helpful.  Decor is nice.  Prices are reasonable.  I'm interested to try the lunch specials next time.\", \"Awesome food. Small restaurant in a small shopping plaza but don't let looks fool you. Probably the best Thai food I've ever eaten. Very authentic, fresh and flavorful. Also great customer service. You won't be disappointed.\", \"Wow! Sooooooo good. Best green curry I've ever had. Service was amazing as well. Hidden gem, check it out!\", 'There was no one in the place so the chef/owner engaged us in conversation both before and after dinner including a display of his tattoos that mirrored the mural on the back wall. The menu is pretty much what you will find in every other Thai restaurant so we ended up with shared orders of Pad Thai with shrimp and stir fried basil chicken.  Both were well executed.', \"Tried this new restaurant today for lunch with a friend from Bangkok and another from Vancouver. Had the Pad See Ew and it was delicious.  Ordered it with a level-2 spice to make sure it wasn't too hot for the first time.  It was perfect. The chicken was cooked to perfection and very juicy and tender.  My friend from Vancouver had the Boat Noodle Soup and my friend from Bangkok had the Tom Yum Noodle Soup and both said it was very authentic and fantastic. I would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for traditional Thai food.\", 'Walking in, I noticed that the decor seemed traditionally Thai. Everything was really clean and new with the restaurant being less than three months old.\\n\\nMy meal started off with the owner approaching us and introducing himself to us, Ken. He talked with us and let us know that everything was made in house. The recipes they used are traditional and after tasting them, you can tell it is different than most other Thai places. Ken recommended to us trying the fish cakes and chicken wings. The fish cakes had a slight crisp on the outside and a chewy inside. The chicken wings were marinated overnight with their own recipe and had the fried outer layer and a nice tender inside. After came out main dishes. I ordered the panang curry and the rest of my party ordered pad thai. The panang curry was really good. It was a bit sweet and had a nice strong curry flavor that was aided by the coconut milk. The pad thai was good as well, but different than most commercial Thai places. The fried egg roll and dumpling that came with the the lunch special were fried to perfection and were nice and crispy on the outside, with a soft inside. After out lunch, we had dessert, a chocolate cake. Ken let us know that all the desserts are made in house by his wife since his wife has a baking background. The chocolate cake was absolutely delicious. To say the least, it was a great ending to our lunch. \\n\\nI enjoyed my meal quite a bit here, along with talking to Ken. He made me feel really comfortable and I will definitely paying them another visit in the future.', \"I ordered Lunch special Padthai Shrimp with Chicken satay and Spaghetti green curry on Wednesday. Their foods are very small portions. Padthai for lunch portion seems like I had only couple bites and then all gone. I know it's only $7 for lunch but the portion is too small anyway. Amd I think they should have lunch special like 7-10 things for choosing. They have like 3 things for lunch and everyday is difference. Like if I want Padthai shrimp and chicken satay I have to come on Wednesday only. So I don't think it's good choice. So I don't think I will come back.\", \"This is our first time here.. The service is great. The newly renovated environment is very inviting. The food is authentic. If you are here in Las Vegas, we highly recommend this place. Try their banana cake.. It's to die for\", \"Got lucky enough to stumble upon Ken's place when he first got started. Can't say enough positive things about the food and the service. It's always incredibly clean and pleasant, and my favorite dish is the Panang Curry. A place where I always feel like a valued customer; it's now my go to spot for Thai!\", 'A co-worker was raving about this new restaurant and told me to check it out. Knowing how snobby she is on where she eats and her excellent taste in different types of cuisines, I decided to take my family out to dinner to this place last month and immensely enjoyed the food! It was such a pleasant surprise! We were truly impressed by how everything was prepared and how they tasted! Our server was very friendly and attentive and even introduced us to Chef Ken. As the saying goes, \"don\\'t judge the book by its cover\", the area where it\\'s located didn\\'t look appealing but once you step in it\\'s like being in an upscale restaurant. It\\'s quite a drive from where we live but it\\'s worth the trip so we will be back!', \"This probably be my go to Thai food place. We had the following:\\n1. Pork larb \\n2. Shrimp tom yum goon\\n3. Yellow chicken curry\\n4. Shrimp pad tai. \\nEach one of those dishes were absolutely delicious. I think it is better than the Lotus of Siam. I made the mistake of ordering 4 dishes, because they were so good I ate them all. I couldn't move because I was stuffed.  I would definitely recommend going to this place and go on a empty stomach so you can eat.\\n\\nYou really get you money worth for the quality and flavor of the food.\", \"This is my first and second Thai food experience and I'm glad it was here.  From the outside, it looks like a hole in the wall.  But it's just great!  It's calm inside and although not perfectly decorated, you can tell they care about their presentation.  The service is EXCELLENT!  Very nice and they are very quick to refill waters without asking, checking back often, if you even make eye contact at all, they'll likely come over.  And the food is great too.  I'm not able to handle a lot of spicy and I ordered a 5 thinking that's middle of the road, but it was a bit too spicy for me.  It was doable and still good but I was chugging water.  I'd say go lower and then add sauce to it if need be. My mom came with me this second time and she usually never compliments anywhere, and she made a point to let our server know she'll be coming back.  Must try!\", 'Pad Thai was so tastee & large. I could not finish , took home. Very clean, prices are really good. My wife is thai, she liked her noodle soup, I thought it tasted smoother than some other places, my cream cheese crab puffs were still good at home later. Nice owner, large booths.', 'Randomly found this on Yelp.. Absolutely amazing :) the cashew dish was perfect. The waitress said it was her favorite, and I see why. Also ordered the coconut lemongrass soup.. Really flavorful and fresh. Overall it seems like good quality of ingredients.. Very homemade and authentic feeling, and talented chef with culinary complexity in the flavor profiles. Definitely coming back', 'Best Thai food in town! I order from here at least once a week, I work in the same shopping center, and the food is always amazing and the staff is very friendly and attentive. I have definitely gotten my coworkers hooked on their food as well.', \"This small little restaurant has a very nice decor. The blood(liver +intestine) soup was amazing.  I usually get the shrimp Tom yum soup but took a risk. Glad I did and now I think I will order the blood soup at this restaurant from now on. The owner came to our table and he was very friendly. The papaya salad was good too. The basil beef and chicken pad thai wasn't bad either. But the dish of the day was the blood soup.\", 'I love how the chef/owner is out in the dinning room making sure everything is perfect. This place is amazing and the food is spectacular. Just opened Jan 1st and we have been here twice.', \"When you're located in the same block as Weera Thai, you're going to have a hard time if your kitchen isn't up to par- the dining room is nice and going for a more upscale vibe, but they have cheap ($7) weekday lunch specials. But unfortunately the food just wasn't up to par for me.\\n\\nFISH CAKES APP: 5/$10 Small, oily, and a bit bland. I enjoyed the cucumber dipping sauce but this didn't pop needed a hit of acidity or something.\\nPAPAYA SALAD: BF requested this and devoured the entire portion. Sauce was slightly spicy, did not like the half-frozen green beans used though.\\nCRAB FRIED RICE: This was listed on the board as a daily special. Portion was large enough, and I like that the extra bit of attention and effort were put into presentation even though this was a takeout order. However, I asked for a spice level of 5 (on their 1-10 scale) and this had no spice whatsoever. I ended up dumping two cups of chili paste and some red pepper flakes into the dish to give it some heat. It's a huge pet peeve of mine to be asked for a spice level and then not even take it into account when cooking the dish. It was even on the receipt so I'm not sure who dropped the ball.\\n\\nLocated in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it spot on Sahara next door to a leather goods shop, it's not necessarily a place I'll return- the food was fine, but didn't have anything about it to stand out from the sea of other thai places on the block.\", \"It's a higgen gem located in a run down shopping strip on Sahara. \\n\\nI heard about this place through my boyfriend. The first time we stopped by few weeks ago, it was closed. I  called them today but noone picks up the phone. Anyways, we decided to drive there. \\n\\nThe place is small and with cute table settings. Pleasant Thai music were playing in the background. The menu looks to be authentic Thai food.\\n\\nWe went there for lunch and it was served on time. We ordered kinthai chicken wings, very crispy and good, comes with a sweet sauce. They sliced the wings into half which was interesting. Pad see Eww with pork was equally palatable and Kinthai fried rice was gratifying too.\\n\\nThe spice rating is 1-10, and it usually comes pretty spicy. So I like to down the spice a notch and get the spice tray.\\n\\nThe service was good. The girl gave us suggestions on the food that helped us, she was nice and very accommodating. I highly recommend coming here and we'll definitely be going back to try other items on the menu.\", \"I originally wanted to go to Weera Thai after hearing good things about it and seeing wonderful photos and reviews, but ended up coming here with my fiancée who bought a Groupon for this place. We ordered the pad Thai, masaman curry with chicken and fried tofu, and garlic beef. The pad Thai was okay, nothing special. It had shrimp in it that obviously we're not fresh. The masaman curry had a good flavor, and it was my favorite item. No complaints. The garlic beef however....was so chewy I ended up having to swallow the pieces practically in their original form. I could not masticate them if I tried. Which I did, for around 5 minutes before my jaw started hurting. The flavor was good, but the quality of the beef was terrible. Terrible. I would not return unfortunately, but I look forward to trying Weera Thai down the street from here.\", \"Best Thai restaurant I've been to in awhile. Amazing customer service! I went two days in a row! New favorite and KinThai will definitely be a weekly spot for me!\", \"Found this nicely cozy restaurant on restaurant.com website...\\n\\nFood was great, very nicely decorated, clean and attentive staff.

Food is delicious and tasty. Try their papaya salad and crab fried rice- soo good. Place is elegant and cozy. Would definitely go back.', \"Got groupons for this place.  To be honest, we never would have tried this place if not for that.

I love this restaurant.\\nIf you like Thai food. You have to try at KIN THAI ^^', \"Our first time here and we're using a Groupon. Great and fast service, great people and amazing dinner food. Good atmosphere and decorations once inside the place. We ordered chicken satay, fried rice, and others, tasted great and left with our tummy full. The prices are at the low average, nothing unreasonable. The location is not a well maintained and it is an old strip commercial complex. You'll have to slow your driving speed to find it or you'll be lost.\", \"I came here with a small group of family friends during slower lunch hours of the day, and we were nearly the only people there. the atmosphere was crisp and clean, the music being a loop of truly neutral marimba-only jams, however, the white walls above our heads were quietly begging to be decorated. the waitress was friendly and the service was perfectly adequate. I was eating here with three white people, one of which was a tweenage girl who complained that everything we ordered was spicy, (it was all under a 5), but I enjoyed myself. this particular place puts the straw mushrooms into the soups rather than just regular ones, which I really appreciated. the only item of questionable quality was the seafood in the kinthai fried rice, which was cooked to displeasing texture despite the good flavor of the rice itself. overall, I enjoyed the dining experience and would say it's worth your try if you're in the area and looking for good prices and a relaxed neutral environment.\", \"Thoroughly enjoyed our meal!\\n\\nWe had pad Thai, tom yum fried rice, red curry, tamarind seabass, crab rangoons and pot stickers. I would recommend everything but the seabass - it wasn't my cup of tea. The tom yum fried rice was a highlight that I haven't had elsewhere. \\n\\nIt's in a rough area but is clean and nice inside. \\n\\nAll waitstaff were pleasant and attentive.\", 'Excellent service and great food at a great price. We tried red curry, phad thai and pineapple fried rice. Everything came exactly as we ordered. They also did the vegetarian versions of what we ordered with the right amount of spice. Highly recommended!!', \"What a surprise I encountered as I randomly stopped in here for lunch! The food was perfect: well executed dishes plated pleasingly and the 7 of 10 spice level I asked for left an impression but didn't linger past its welcome. Warm and inviting ambience for this hidden gem tucked away in an unassuming strip mall. Bring all your friends! This is great Thai food. \\n\\nGreen Curry chicken lunch special \\nSom Tum: papaya salad\", \"For me It's the best Thai restaurant in Vegas!!! Such a delicious food. Quality of service and food on high level . such a great atmosphere. I will comeback there again .  I would give 5+ . Thai food lovers it's a must go place .\", 'I am absolutely hooked on the \"Pad See Ew\" dish here.  My wife and I discovered this place a few months back, and we eat here (or take out) at least once a week.  Great selection, low prices, and even a nice atmosphere.  Most of the nearby restaurants are very tiny and lacking personality, but this is a great hidden gem.', 'I love Thai food and when I saw a new place had opened near me, I had to check it out.\\nThe location is easy to find with plenty of parking.  Inside the decor is clean and relaxing.  \\nWe were served very quickly and our server was very knowledgeable about the menu.  \\nWe ordered satay, pad Thai and panang curry and each dish was great.

The smell when you first walk in is a cross between strange cleaning product smell and no cleaning product smell and at 8pm on a Friday night the place was completely empty... as in zero customers. The pot stickers appetizer didn't have a lot of flavor. The spicy basil pork with a side of white rice was good, not the best I've ever had but it was good. The beef satay was not good...didn't have much flavor and was about as tender as my high school prom shoes. The wait staff were friendly and accommodating but with no one else there to wait on, we got great service. The entire time we were there only one other couple came in to eat. That made us a bit suspicious as to what others know that we didn't...\", \"What can I say besides the food is the best Thai I've had outside of Thailand. Very authentic and reasonably priced. I asked for the crab curry and requested a 6/10 spice because I enjoy spicy foods more than the average American. My dish arrived with the perfect amount of spice. Not too hot but nothing weak either. Will visit again to try the other dishes. The spicy coconut soups are a must have.\", \"This is the best Thai restaurant ever employees are very friendly it's clean,decorated nicely, quiet with a great atmosphere,most of all food  tastes wonderful and the servings are generous. It has only been open for 6 months. I want to see this place be a success please everyone come here to eat and trust me I'm a fat person I wouldn't lie if the food was bad.\", 'Really fantastic flavors! Everything tasted so homemade.

Great prices, substantial portions and flavor that delights the tastebuds!', 'Very good thai food! My family and I had a groupon so we decided to try it out. The service was a bit subpar for how empty the restaurant was (server was in the back talking most of the time). The food was delicious! I had Pad Thai - very traditional and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. We also shared Satay and Tom Kha. Both were quite good. The plating for the Satay was clever - the skewers were on top of a slice of pineapple!\\n\\nI suggest it!', 'Great lunch specials for $7 that came with a potsticker and an egg roll.  I ordered the pad see ew beef, my coworker had the drunken noodles with chicken, and her bf had the panang curry lunch special.  Everything was so good, the service is great since there was hardly anyone there, and the restaurant is nice and clean, albeit a little quiet (like a library).  The food is good, though, so I will definitely come back!', 'First off I am a huge fan of Weera Thai one strip mall over; however, this restaurant was lovely, great food and service.  It is a little fancier than Weera but priced the same. We will go back.', \"I've been looking for a great thai place in vegas and I think I found it! Everything was amazing! I ordered the tom yum , beef pad thai and papaya salad\", \"Real solid Thai food, not too sweet like other places. Authentic Thai taste. From the outside looks a bit run down, but inside is nice and classy. Good size portions also, reasonable prices for good tasting food. I would come again. Btw my wife is Thai and she knows what's real and what is catered to American tastes, the food here is made the proper way.\", 'Mixed bag here.  We ordered the pad thai, chicken masaman curry and garlic beef.  The flavors on all three dishes were good, my favorite being the curry.  The curry flavor was strong and tasted sweet and delicious.  The garlic beef also had a nice flavor and the pad thai had a succulent fish sauce glaze.  The problem though was the freshness of ingredients.  The beef was super chewy, like they used really a cheap cut.  The shrimp in the pad thai was stringy and chewy like it was from a frozen stock.  The second part that was dissapointing was the portions were a bit small, espexially the pad thai.  \\nHope they improve their quality a little and it will definitley be higher scores!', 'You will enjoy a really good taste in each plate, my favorite is sour & sweet . \\nI recommend 100%.

This was nice, and it made it easy to watch.\\n\\nFor our meal, we had a 2 meat platter (pulled pork and brisket) and a 3 meat platter (ribs, hot link and BBQ chicken).  For sides, we had mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, beans and potato salad.  \\n\\nPulled pork:  standard, decently juicy but dry in spots.  Needed sauce.\\n\\nBrisket:  tender and flavorful but a bit dry.  I bet if you get a good piece of this it\\'s a winner.\\n\\nRibs:  great flavor, tender, but not too tender.  The end was slightly burnt.\\n\\n\"Hot\" Link:  this was not spicy at all, and is more akin to a polish sausage.  It would be great if called a sausage and not a hot link.\\n\\nChicken:  the dark meat was better than the white, which was a little dry.\\n\\nThe mac n cheese was the best side by far.  The beans and potato salad were not good.  Lacked flavor.  \\n\\nAlso, a hot sauce on the table would be nice other than Tabasco.  Just spice up the normal sauce with cayenne powder or something.  \\n\\nOverall, the portions are large and you may get messy.

Horrible food.', 'my two roommates and I decided to venture out to north forty because we had all wanted to try it for months but never got around to it. we\\'ve had great nights out while drinking at the south las vegas branch so we were excited going into it. This place took over an old \"roadrunner\" bar and grill that we enjoyed both for food and entertainment. \\n\\nWe went on a sunday evening around 6 o\\'clock. there were only about FOUR tables occupied besides our own. we ordered a sampler platter, prime rib, and a burger. \\n\\nBurger: good size, very bland, ordered only TWO toppings one was missing. \\n\\nsampler: it was appetizers so hard to mess up. nothing on there was that good though. chicken wings were alright. \\n\\nprime rib: TERRIBLE. we hate sending food back but this thing was tough as hell, not very hot (probably sitting there since that afternoon). we sent it back, and the replacement was just as bad. DON\\'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. \\n\\nour waitress was very friendly, however, she took our order correctly but messed up the burger order AND totally forgot to bring an order of potato skins to the table and STILL billed it to us. when we brought it up she said \"we have no idea where it went....are you sure you didn\\'t get it?\"\\nwhat kind of question is that? either it wasn\\'t made or you took it to the wrong table and the people there didn\\'t speak up. don\\'t talk to us like we are so dumb that we can\\'t remember getting one of 4 plates or decided to eat and hide the plate to pocket a cool 6 bucks. \\n\\nI may visit for the nightlife, but i will never revisit or recommend their food. bring back roadrunners or at least the cooks!', \"I really, really like this place. It feels like Texas, sounds like Texas, and tastes like Texas (I'm from Texas). The food is excellent. My husband and I disagree about whether North Forty or Famous Dave's is better, but we do agree that North Forty's brisket wins hands down. Solid 4 stars. \\nMy only suggestion is to please get fried okra on the menu! If you do that, I'll come back and give you 5 stars! (okra blackmail!!)\", \"The month of July they were running a $12.95 AYCE ribs daily ( normally only done 2-9 Sundays) so the BF wanted to go. We have passed up this place for late night eats since it becomes country nightlife and I'm about as country as Anna Wintour. We came for lunch when it was quiet though the country music playing capped my year dose. \\n\\nThe ribs themselves were surprisingly good. There was a visible smoke ring on the ribs and the smokey flavor was present and just the right amount. The ribs were trimmed right as they werent overly fatty, the were tender, juicy and meaty. They had 3 types of sauces - original, a spicy and a sweet one and all were solid. \\n\\nThe plate comes with 2 sides and cornbread. Both the BF and I grabbed cowboy beans which was really good sweetness but a touch of tang. I got mac n cheese which at first I wasnt a fan of, but I grew to like after a few bites. It seems like it's milk cooked so its less saucy but had flavor. The BF grabbed some tater tots which were really crispy though slightly salty to me. The cornbread I wasn't a fan of as it was very dry and seemed stale. \\n\\nService was friendly and good. She checked on us, brought us ribs, filled our drinks in a timely manner. \\n\\nI am pleasantly surprised with this place. I thought it was gonna have adequate BBQ, but it's pretty solid. We rarely eat meat, or a lot of meat but I would definitely consider coming back with my in laws who like BBQ. It's far North but if you're in the area and want BBQ ribs this is definitely going to satisfy.\", \"To Rate Stoney N40 you have to actually look at the two sides of Stoney's, the saloon/food and the club/dance hall. Food half four stars, club/dance hall pushing 3. This is a smoke free location which is a huge plus. I prefered Stoney's over Revolver for this reason.\\n\\nFirst off with the good: The food and service is excellent. We eat at the bar and the bartenders have always made every meal the best. Each time we've asked to substitute something else on the menu we have been accommodated. I've eaten at Famous Dave's, Mesquite BBQ, Dickie's and Lucile's.. I think Stoney's is on par with Famous Dave's, the customer service, and the local feel gives it a step above any franchise. We eat here weekly and if you don't like the food, your just don't know good BBQ. They need to advertise more though.\\n\\nThe Bad: The club/dance hall is lacking. They are competing with Revolver which is close by. Stoney's has recently started mixing club music within country music. Listening to Luke Bryant then going to Lady Gaga. It just doesn't do it for me at all. This typically brings in a mix from country hats to flat bill affliction-tapout-wear-young kids. Mostly everyone gets along well. They need to have gaming machines at the bar to bring in more people, which will bring in more revenue and hopefully then they can go back to being a country bar,\", \"Stoney's was a big hit with us.  It's not normally a place I'd take my kids to, but I didn't choose the restaurant and we were going for a birthday dinner...  Even though I wouldn't normally take my kids, it wasn't uncomfortable either, since there were a handful of other kids there, too.  \\n\\nWe were a group of 15 people, including 5 kids (and 2 babies) and we did *not* make a reservation.  We tried to call but couldn't get through.  The hostess had a relaxed friendly attitude when I asked about the availability of getting a table for that many people.  The manager, Cliff, got us seated in 5 minutes and seemed happy to have us, not annoyed that we had children.\\n\\nOur server, Sam, couldn't have been better.  She was upbeat and always there to fill our drinks.  Our food came out surprisingly fast, too!  The only downfalls for me personally was the limited selection on some things.  They don't carry any Ciders, and the only white wine they have is Chardonnay.  They also don't have any green veggies besides the salad.  But what they DO have is really, really, really good.  Not really the place for those on a health-food kick!  \\n\\nI had the two-plate combo with brisket and pulled pork.  The brisket was extremely tender, and the pulled pork was just the way I like it - juicy, but not drowning in sauce.  I had a simple side salad and a baked potato with the works, and it also came with corn on the cob (a little mushy for my taste) and a really good cornbread muffin.  My oldest son had the Philly and wasn't too crazy about it, (too much bread, and he said it wasn't hot enough), but my youngest son loved the kid's sliders and fries. \\n\\nEveryone in our party was impressed with the level of service for such a casual place, especially being so busy!  There must have been like 30 people on the dancefloor line-dancing, ranging from kids, to older couples, to girls in Daisy-Dukes!  It was a fun yet clean and family-friendly atmosphere.  Sam really out-did herself, and Cliff was not the manager that stood around - he was helping to check on and reset tables.  I would definitely go back, only next time, I'm leaving the kids at home!\", \"After the remodel they hang a huge sign that says FREE beer Fridays.  You pretty much have to go if you see that right?\\n\\nSo I stop in with a friend about 9:00 at night.  It is nice inside - more of a dance club than a restaurant or bar.  Huge dance floor with some tables around.  It has an outdoor patio, too.  The venue is set up for a good dance place.\\n\\n$5 cover - maybe it was $10 can't remember.  Not too busy.  The free beer is natty light or PBR!  Yeeha.. passed on that and ordered some drinks.  Bartenders were friendly.\\n\\nNo comment on the food, I thought it was like a club...didn't even see anyone eating.\\n\\nSo I am looking around to see if there are some attractive available ladies to chat with - and the dance floor has like teenagers line dancing???  What is that???  Who brings their kids to a night club?  I guess they are 21 and over after 10:00pm.   That was wierd.  The crowd over all wasn't too much fun.  Some goofballs there for some free beer.  I thought they were going to start smashing the cans on their forehead!  \\n\\nThis place could be turned into a fun honkey tonk kinda place...but for now - i would skip it. Vegas could use a fun locals joint.  \\n\\nStoney - drop the free beer nights.  Get a band in there.  Do a ladies night or something.  Get a mechanichal bull.  Free PBR is just dumb!\", \"I was very surprised by this place as I drive by it all of the time and rarely see a soul in there.  When IHOP was too crowded for breakfast one morning my husband and I opted to try their breakfast.  It was really pretty decent!  The patio is really cute and the wait staff was all over us making sure we were checked on every minute. Everyone was welcoming and super friendly.  Breakfast taters were really good - recommend those.  I had the western omelet which was good but seemed to have two slices of processed cheese slices melted on top.  Tasted good though.  Their menu for breakfast is pretty limited though.  Not sure what it's like at night since I'm not a fan of country bars, but the food was good and from what I hear their ribs are pretty good.  Might try it again for dinner or happy hour.\", \"We tried to have a nice breakfast on Sunday morning. However the service rates as one of the worst I've experienced. First off, it took 10 minutes to place our drink order. The bartender had to come over because the service was so slow. Then after placing the order and waited for an hour, the waitress came by saying our order got mixed up. Can I tell you how difficult it is to entertain kids that long? Then when I asked for the manager to explain the enormous delay, manager did not come within 10 minutes. We left. If you have kids,  DO NOT GET BREAKFAST HERE. Our bad for thinking this was a kid friendly restaurant.\", 'Another country restaurant/bar option if you want to head north...', \"After a nice day just driving around seeing how much Vegas had grown, we run up on Stoney's North Forty. We didn't know what to think, but we ventured in like a couple old people that lost our way. The waitress (Kristy) came right over and showed us how to get to the table and chairs. \\nKristy recommended the special for lunch, Ham and Bacon Sandwich with French fries and the fixings for homemade fry sauce. She kept our glasses full of ice cold water. \\nShe then recommended a deep fried apple pie with ice cream. Ummmm good and enough to share. \\nThe lunch special and desert came to $18.34 plus tip. A very good lunch, A must try again\", 'Great country bar.  Free dance lessons, drink deals almost every day.  Not the best place to eat with a group after 7pm, but only because they start their music then and it is hard to talk at the table.', \"I love this place!!!! I admit I was depressed when Roadrunner Saloon left and Stoney's moved in.  People at worked asked me to meet them there for dinner and I was hesitant.  Boy was I wrong!!!! \\nThe food is amazing and the staff has always been super friendly!  Everytime we go we have a group of 15+ people and we always get great service. My husband and I started ordering carry out from here almost once a week.  The ribs are phenomenal, cornbread to die for, and onion rings yummy!! My son loves their Mac n cheese and my hubby loves their chicken tender salad.  Co-workers RAVE about the brisket!!!\\nThey also offer a lot of coupons which makes it that much better! We get buy one meal get one free coupons every other week and they are on Groupon Now everyday.  If you are looking for great food, this is the place!!!\\n\\nJust for the record, I have no affiliation to Stoney's!! I know people read good reviews and automatically think someone who works there wrote it.  I just wanted to give an honest take of how good this place is because everytime I go they never disappoint!!!!\", 'This place is a lot of fun to go to! it is not the nightclub feel at all. There is no cover charge and wednesday nights are ladies nights and its unlimited free drinks for women & fridays are unlimited beer for $5. There are free line dance lessons wed-saturday at 730. these would be very helpful if you don\\'t know the dancing! There is a lot of country music and almost all of it is to line dancing, and two step. They play some pop to line dancing & also have bouts of \"freestyle\" and play hiphop/rap/pop. it is a very fun enviornment and there\\'s tables to sit at, friendly cocktail waitreses & bartenders, there\\'s beer pong, pool tables, a mechanical bull, an outside patio....its a fun time! \\n\\ntheres breakfast, lunch, dinner served & i\\'ve never been, but then around 8pm ish they start changing the setting to the night bar atmosphere. \\n\\nAfter 7pm it\\'s 18+ & then if they are enforcing it (don\\'t always) 18-20 year olds have to leave by 930-1030.', \"Had come here previously with a $10 for $20 groupon on sunday for AYCE ribs. I thought all you got were ribs and you had to buy the sides, but nope. The AyCE ribs came with 2 sides, corn, and cornbread. They bring out half a rack to start you off, and boy were they tender and fall off the bone good. I was pleasantly surprised that they were bbq'd so well. After i devoured my half rack, I kept asking for more ribs and they came in 3's. I like this idea so that way they stay warm and fresh versus having to eat cold ribs that sat on my plate and turned cold by the time I get to them. \\n\\nService was excellent and they even had a band playing while you ate. The music was entertaining. \\n\\nI would be back. \\n\\nUpdate: apparently no one answers the phones as I wanted to know if they still had the sunday AYCE special ad the website is gone.\\n\\nUpdate again 8/25/12: They are now out of business. RIP North Forty\", \"The food was great, but it was so slow that night that the huge building just seemed sad. There were only two servers working (?) and so the service was a little slow. In my opinion, the food was better than the other bbq joints that I have tried in Vegas; Memphis Championship, Buzz, TC's, and Famous Dave's.\", 'Let me start out that I absolutely love the atmosphere of learning how to line dance, along with having a huge section of food and entertainment (pool, bar, and gambling)!\\n\\nThe food is AMAZING! I know that out of all of the trays we had ordered... the sausages, ribs, and pulled pork had been annihilated! I highly recommend ordering any of those three along with the beans and mashed potatoes for side dishes! Also, we came here on a Saturday night, so the event may have been a bit more entertaining with such a large crowd of individuals I have never met before!', \"Service was slow, don't ever try beer battered bacon.\", \"Went in for breakfast.  Chicken fried steak and eggs- reminds me of my great grandfather's cooking.  Staff is extremely friendly and attentive.  The waitress outfits   Are a plus also.  Will definitely be back.  And the owner is not a racist as said in a previous review-just believes in the Constitution and the conservative ideas that helped create our nation's charter.\", \"Great place for large takeout orders.  We've just had the Austin Feast and it more than lived up to expectations.  Ribs were great, the brisket was really good and no complaints with any of the sides.  The BBQ sauce made every part better.  Definitely the best BBQ joint in the Northwest since Salt Lick left the Santa Fe.  One con was that it took three calls to have anyone pick up to place the order (after a long automated phone maze).\", \"Intollerable. This place wouldn't even honor their own Mother's Day special poasted on their own website. There were five servers for eleven tables. I don't know how many cooks were in back but it took over 40 minutes to get my food. Ten minutes before that for a server to even take my order. I can't tell you how many people I saw up and leave. My girlfriend and I should have been one of them. The food that came out was subpar. I think we managed to get all the heals of bread as our toast. The only thing that I had that was good were the pancakes. You may want to ask for more syrup though as mine were served with approximately two tablespoons of the sweet stuff...Thinking about breakfast or lunch? Do yourself a favor and visit a restaurant across the street.\", \"I have been here a number of times; there is not many food choices in the Northwest. Yesterday I came here for breakfast with a friend. I like their breakfast overall. The have later breakfast hours than most places, although only offered on weekends. It is about $10 per entree, however, it appeared popular as there were many families and kids eat free for breakfast. I have had the hash and eggs here, the hash is made there, but I will say it isn't traditional it is more like chopped up brisket - and I like it although I wouldn't really call it hash.  This last time I had the chili cheese omelet and pancakes. They have huge portions, and I don't know if the pancakes were a mix, probably, but they were good and hot. The omelet was tasty, a decent amount of melted cheese and good chili.   I will say that the hash browns were frozen which was a down side. The country potatoes are made there (at least per asking before) but they were kind of mushy before so I didn't get them. I have been here for dinner before too - not my favorite BBQ but pretty good brisket and again they are good enough that I would go back. The sides are lacking - the corn tastes frozen and I don't have anything that really sticks out as a decent side, but overall due to the meat I like it, and they have brewed ice tea.\", '$5 lunch specials and girls in daisy dukes!  What more could a man ask for..  Love this place', \"So, I think I have figured it out: Stoney's is a great place for cheap taco's & beer during football. It's fun at night for country line-dancing. It's just not a great restaurant, not even for lunch. Both times that we have gone to sit down & eat we were disappointed with the food, service & price.\\nSo, it's not my choice for dining out, that's ok, cuz on a Monday afternoon, don't be surprised to see me hanging on to the bar eating cheap food & pounding beers.\", \"When I first walked into Stoney's North Forty, I thought I walked into a hamster cage, not a restaurant. While I could have done without the wood chips scattered throughout the floor of North Forty, the food and service was actually quite good! This came as a surprise to me because this place was completely empty! \\n\\nEven though I don't dance (I'm as white as they come) and I hate country music (okay; maybe I'm NOT as white as they come), I felt comfortable eating inside of North Forty. With the big dance floor in the middle of the restaurant, I envisioned how rednecks must be having the time of their lives on Friday and Saturday nights. With FREE dance lessons and occasional FREE live events (American Idol's Bo Bice, baby!), Stoney's North Forty is a white people paradise.\\n\\nThe food itself at North Forty was pretty good. From the smell emanating from the restaurant you could tell they use a BBQ smoker. The portions that you receive for the price are about what you would expect. I didn't really care for the coleslaw (made with horseradish and slimy), but the philly cheese steak was big, tasty, and made me hot in the pants. Don't expect extraordinary eats at North Forty, but there is a little something for everyone. Did I mention they have their own homemade barbecue sauces? YEE HAW, PARDNER!\\n\\nIf you take away the poop sprayed all over one of the ladies room toilets and the wood chips on the floor (sorry to repeat myself; the wood chips aren't only tacky but how do you sweep around them? If they sweep...), Stoney's North Forty would have earned a four star rating. For lack of a more creative finish; go to Stoney's, cowboy.\", 'The latest in the Saga of Eating Challenges.....Stoney\\'s North Forty was selected as the location for the 4 lb Omelet eating challenge.  Scheduled for a 9 AM start, I had to rush to get there in time to witness the action.  Four guys in our group of 12 were going for it.\\n\\nI didn\\'t participate in the Challenge, but posted some pics of the Giant Omelette & participants.  I brought my Son along to witness the tomfoolery.  We opted to split an order of Potato Skins....yeah, I know B-O-R-I-N-G.....compared to the 4 lb Omelet, but I knew there was no way I could do it and I didn\\'t feel like starting off my Sunday with a major stomachache.  The Skins were topped with Sour Cream, Bacon, Beef, Cheese, and Green Onions....Ranch was provided for dipping.  To wash it down, I had an Iced Tea.\\n\\nOur food came out pretty fast and the waitress was pretty cool to handle our huge order.  The Omelets came out first.....they are really, really BIG!  Not only is it a giant Omelet....but it\\'s covered in Gravy, and you must eat 2 Biscuits & Hasbrowns in addition to that thing in order to complete the challenge.  Scott T gave it a valiant effort and came up a few ounces short of finishing the Omelet....seriously, check out the pic....he was soooo close, but couldn\\'t do it.  Ken M who organized this thing did ok....respectable.....plus had ate it with a Shiner Bock....+1 for Ken for a Beer at 9 AM!\\n\\nOur Skins were very tasty.....the combination of toppings went well together.  The Sour Cream was drizzled over the top of the Skins instead of a blob of it that you have to put on yourself.....for some reason I prefer it drizzled over the Skins like they do it.  The Skins are very large too.....and stuffed full of the toppings....I\\'m glad I split it with my Son.....I was full after eating 1/2 of the order.\\n\\nLooking around the joint, it\\'s a Country Western Dance Hall at night with plenty of room on the dance floor.  There\\'s also a mechanical Bull in the corner for those who dare.....needless to say, nobody in our group was in the mood for a Bull Ride.....not after trying to house a 4 lb Omelet, ha!\\n\\nOverall, it was a great time....Will I return?  Yee haw!  that means \"Yes\" in Cowboy....I think.', 'This was my first time here and it was for monday night football. Eagles vs Redskins. Me and two buddies went because we heard about the $5 all you can drink beer during the game with nickel drafts during half time and free shots every touch down.The free beer is either Busch or Busch lite, I went with the light and it was just fine. Plus before the game it was buy one get one free! Needless to say it was a pretty good deal. We sat down and ordered $1 worth of tacos each and that hit the spot. The tacos were only 25 cents each and they were big and delicious.\\n\\n The game starts and the first pass is a touchdown, That means free shots! This music comes on thats now one of my favorites and says shots shots shots to some house music! Long story short the game broke the monday night football scoring record and I got about 9-10 free shots. After the game the place pretty much cleared out and we left at around 9:00 p.m.   \\n\\nThe waitresses and bartenders are pretty friendly and fast. All and all it was a great monday night football hangout and I left with spending about $20 the whole night including tips!! will definately be here every monday night.', 'Got the Groupon (or Living Social) deal they had offered a while back, pay $10 for $20 worth of food! So that was a bonus going in!\\n\\nNow, getting into the facility - as a first timer, I was kind of looking around before getting out of the vehicle. Kinda sketchy seeing what I felt was a homeless individual sitting on the curb of the property. \\n\\nWalking in - the place is HUGE! Wide open, and tall ceilings. When walking in, first view is the bar after the hostess area. You don\\'t even see any of the tables, as it is all hiding behind a mini wall barrier and blends in with the wood walls. Got to the table, and gotta say I love the old fashioned wooden vibe in this place. A small ding on cleanliness of the tables and chairs. As I was moving down the booth, my hand kept coming across crumbs from previous diners. Was not very pleasant to feel that, and having to wipe my hands to clean off someone else\\'s crumbs.\\n\\nI had gone on a week night, so there really wasn\\'t much of a crowd - kinda surprising for a week night right at prime time dining (6pm), so that kinda made me skeptical of the food right off the bat. But I held my hopes out.\\n\\nI really did want to try the bbq meats, but my poor lil tummy just would not tolerate an all you can eat affair. I would not have gotten my money\\'s worth of ribs! So instead I opted for the catfish (OK HUGE MASSIVE ALMIGHTY PROPS for having catfish on the menu!!!!! Haven\\'t seen catfish on a menu in this valley until now, and I do like my catfish.) Now - you do get to choose two sides, so I chose - salad and coleslaw and threw veggies as an extra to balance it all out. (and I ended up having a cornbread and two little hushpuppy bites as well included in the meal).\\n\\nThe catfish - YUMMY crust! I\\'m very used to beer battered fish, so was thinking hmm don\\'t know how the cornmeal crust thing is gonna work out but I\\'m game for something new. And I was not disappointed! The cornmeal was not hard at all, but had just the right amount of crunch to it without cracking your teeth or getting stuck. The fish very moist and tender, not over done, and not dried out!\\n\\nColeslaw - is a cross between the vinegar and mayo based types. I liked it - had the perfect crunch, and right blend of mayo and vinegar touches. I\\'m more partial to the vinegar based ones (sorry no offense, but no one can beat the yummy morsels from my Grandma\\'s version, which is all vinegar based).\\n\\nVeggies & salad - nothing fancy to report about - frozen veggies - boiled and seasoned or steamed and seasoned. Lettuce, on a plate! (I\\'m just thankful it wasn\\'t iceberg lettuce, which is known for being one of the least nutritional lettuces out there). \\n\\nCornbread - tasty little bite. Very sweet and moist.\\n\\nHushpuppies - oh boy - make sure you have drink readily available. These little devils have quite the kick! They throw in fresh jalapeno bits into the batter, so you get a little fire mouth surprise!\\n\\nNow ---- the folks I was with - several had the all you can eat ribs. I will review these based on appearances only! First off - you can SEEEEEE that beautiful smoke ring in these bad boys! Yes there are places here that have forgotten what a smoke ring is but N 40 is NOT one of them. :) They use a very rich dark rub mixture/ wet mopping technique. So I\\'m assuming molasses or uber caramalized sugar in the mix. Now 3 of our party all had the ribs, and during our dining, they were chowing it all down, finger smacking, and lots of yums going around. The meat was pulling off the bone in the right way - so that it wasn\\'t falling off the bone, but you weren\\'t playing tug of war with it either.\\n\\nSome of the gals had the mac \\'n\\' cheese, and they all had a dislike for it. They all agreed and stated the noodles were dry, and there was not enough of a cheese sauce involved.\\n\\nService wise, we did have a little hiccup (a 15 min. gap) - our waitress had needed a break or something, and said she would make sure we were being looked after - fine no issues. Buuuuut apparently the folks were not to keen on helping her out as they really didn\\'t come over to check up on us, or send out the refills outside of delivering water only once to us. Now our waitress came back and was rightfully peeved that our service was not taken care of (some needing water, others wanting a refill of their ribs, and others needing to go boxes - basic stuff, nothing outstanding). So she was a little short while trying to get everything squared away - and like I said, understandable if she was peeved that her peers weren\\'t helping her out. I would be too if I had been in her shoes. She was very apologetic about the whole thing, and comped some of us, but we weren\\'t really upset about it - just like \"anyone coming soon?\" with some hopeful looks to snag a service person.\\n\\nSoooo - I think I\\'ll come back here again to try the bbq stuff with the fam. \\n\\nHappy dining!', \"We had the Austin sized family meal, which by the way its sooo much food.  I really liked  the meats they were really tender and juicy.  The thing i didn't like was the Mac and Cheese and the Coleslaw, the mac tasted weird and the slaw had waaayy to much mayo, also the cornbread was grainy and super hard, and dry, it was gross, it felt like i was eating sand. But the fries and corn were delicious as the meats.  The place is very clean, its very big, but its to dark.  The service was excellent, our food came out hot and on time.   I'm kinda of in between with this place that's why i give it 3 stars. overall its ok i guess.......\", 'All I need to say is all you can drink free beer on Fridays.']\n",

They gave me two mediums instead of larges, and when I called them to replace the mediums they said that they definitely gave me two larges. \\nI used to work at a pizza place and this is not a large. Well, I went and measured the pizzas while I was waiting for the larges and my measuring tape said 12\".

Granted, its on the strip, it was wildly busy, long line; we waited our turn. It was very loud there, so it was a challenge to get our order in; I ended up with rice vs chow mein (which they did correct, and I appreciated that). The problem was with the cashier, Richard. I assume because of the noise level he was having trouble understanding our drink order; however, after two failed attempts to get the order right, he completely lost his cool and began repeating his questions to us in a very pissy tone of voice (the kind of attitude you take when you are talking to someone who you think is very, very stupid) without giving us time to respond. I eventually had to cut him off and tell him we were trying to order he just was not listening. At that point he stopped speaking whatsoever (other than a final, snotty \"thank you\") and finished the transaction. I am a general manager of a large retail store, and whenever I observe any of my associates behaving in this manner with a customer, I remove them from the selling floor and discuss what the issue is that is causing their inappropriate behavior and how to correct it. None of this happened at Panda; Richard simply moved on to the next customer with the same surly attitude. Now I am sure this location makes money hand over fist, and my one opinion wont matter to any of them in the least, but we will never give this store our business again, no matter how badly we are craving Orange Chicken. If you do give this store your business, avoid Richard at all costs.  His offensive belligerent attitude left a very bad taste in our mouths.', 'They are all the same.

The employee Bailey made it apparent that she did not want to be working there. \\nMy mom asked her for a sample of one the entrees & she grabbed a tooth pick & before she even reached for one my mother asked for the small piece but Bailey grabbed a big one. & she angrily threw the food away & grabbed another toothpick & as she was about to grab another piece my mom reminded her of a small piece. She rolled her eyes, grabbed the the tray of food out of the buffet station & grab another piece & grudgingly gave the toothpick to my mother. \\n\\nThe next employee however, was more pleasant. Unfortunately, I didn't get her name :( \\nI was just sad that my kid's meals rice portion was not full and had empty space. \\nBut overall, if it wasn't for that rude employee, I would honestly rate this place with 5 stars.\", \"Even though the same basic types of alcohol are served in different bars, not all bars are the same. Some bars have bartenders with heavy hands and some don't. It can make or break the experience.\\n\\nWell, the same idea applies to chain cheap eateries such as Subway, Chipotle, and of course, Panda Express. Some servers have heavy hands and some don't. It can make or break the experience.\\n\\nLuckily, the staff here has (very) heavy hands. It made my day and broke the button on my slacks.\", \"If you're looking for a cheap and quick bite to eat, Panda Express is great. \\n\\nFor around $7 you can get a 2 entree meal. If you and a friend aren't too hungry, 2 people could easily split this meal. \\n\\nTheir Large drink is more like an Extra Large. So if you aren't too thirsty, just get the Medium (which is like a large). You can save a little there. \\n\\nYou may already have your mind set on Beef and Broccoli (For Example). However, who knows how long the food has been sitting there?\\n\\nIf you want something more fresh, before standing in line to order, take a look at some of the dishes. This way, you can spot what looks good and what looks like it should have been thrown away days ago.\", \"Long lines during peak hours. Their prices are a lot higher than your normal Panda Express due to the fact that it's on the strip inside a hotel. Overall cleanliness of this place is alright. Don't care for their service though.\", 'Didnt feel great after eating this. Poor service. But good veggie options as always. Too expensive.  When i went there they ran out of spring rolls. Definitely not filling either.', 'Not sure why I was charged $1.50 extra for the bowl but besides that, it was great! This is one of the very few Las Vegas cheapeats. Open late which is a big plus and average priced for the eatery on the strip.', 'take it to go and they give you a ton!\\nsometimes something as simple as panda tastes so good in such a fancy place as VEGAS.', \"I stopped at Panda Express during my visit to the Venetian during the holidays. \\nI had never experienced anything like it. There was a young woman texting on her cellphone while I waited for help. Two people waiting for assistance, a gentleman in front of me and I. I am an avid texter so I decided to be patient while she went on texting.\\n   Much to my surprise, a young man arrives (in Panda Express uniform) and starts kissing her. It was more than the average kiss...lol! She turns to the counter and a bit frustrated makes an attempt to take our orders.\\n   By this time, I'm already contemplating just walking away a few more steps to the other food vendors, when a very nice Asian woman comes to the rescue and starts taking our orders. The food was great.\\n   I know it's fast food Panda Express; I do not expect red carpet treatment here but the kissing part was a little extreme lol! For that reason, I am giving it 2 stars.\"]\n",

      "[\"What a delightful candy shop hidden inside the Boulevard mall (probably the worst mall layout we have ever seen.) You might have better luck getting directions on how to get there by asking the mall employee's, but it's in the same wing as Victoria's Secret.\\n\\nYou are greeted by a bright and colorful storefront, an army of hanging (knockoff) piñatas in all sorts of characters, racks and bins of Mexican sweets and delights, and junk food to fill any child's (or adult's) desires.\\n\\nIt's a Mexican candy wonderland! We were thrilled to see the variety that they had here (trust me, they got the good stuff.) Assortment of lollipops covered in chili, tamarind candies, ground peanut mazapan, mini caramel in wafer sandwiches, sweet and sour, spicy candy powders, chamoy, alfajor, paletas (Mexican ice cream bars), you name it! \\n\\nThe candies in each bin range from 25 cents to a dollar, so you can grab as much or as little as you like, mix and match, and try something unique such as the chili covered mango pops or the chamoy paste to dip your green apples in...they are mouthwatering good!\\n\\nYou have to try thier paletas, we are a huge fan of Mexican ice cream and they have the legit ones here! They have mango, pineapple, strawberry, and coconut. My favorite flavors are definitely strawberry or coconut, they seriously taste perfect and are made with real fruit and cream. Amazing on a sweltering day. We'll take 2 please. \\n\\nThey also have a great chip and snack selection, the American and also the Mexican variety. I also noticed that they had a bunch of other random goods such as Chia seeds, coconut flakes, and raw nuts in packages. We will definitely be back to stock up on our sweet, sour, savory, and spicy goodies!\", \"I'm conflicted about rating this place.  They charge you an extra $.50 to use your card or they tell you to go use a non existent ATM machine to pull money out.  Candy is vastly over priced but the only reason I shopped here anyway is because some of the candy they have is hard to find in the US.  \\n\\nThe woman working here is not nice and not nice about the surcharge.  I know that I could report her to VISA because it is actually against the credit/debit card company to charge customers for the convenience of paying with a card but I'd rather she read on here that I am fully aware of her violation.  Consumer Law 101, so glad I took that class.\", \"Candies Galore!\\n\\nLocated inside the Boulevard Mall, a Mexican style sweet shop awaits you. Looking for a big time sugar rush? Aisles of dulces await you...bonbons, chocolates, paletas, chicles, chips, cookies, THE WORKS!!!\\n\\nThe ladies behind the counter are very nice and helpful, and offer suggestions to any questions you may have on any of their products sold here. This is a great spot to do your Halloween candy shopping, or if you have a kids' party coming up, you'll want to get a piñata for the festivities! There are lots of styles to choose from as well.\\n\\nMix and match your candy selections...The prices here are cheap!  ALOHA!!!\", \"What a joke!!!! This place is the worst, a complete ripoff!!!!! My husband and I found this store on accident, the ladies in the store asked us what kind of pinata we were looking for. We showed them a picture of the cat in the hat, and asked if they could make it custom. They said all they needed was one week. We paid on the spot for the custom pinata, three weeks before our sons 1st birthday. A week later they never called to let us know it was ready so we called them to confirm it was ready. They said they needed another week. We called the next week and they didn't have it ready yet. We asked if try were going to have it ready by our party and they said it would be ready in four days, which was three days before the party. We called three days before our party to confirm before we drove across town to pick it up... Then they told us it would be ready the day of the party. Day of party we are going crazy preparing for 75 guests and prepping and my husband shows up, they said oh the lady has it in her car she's on her way to work give us one hour. So he waits and waits and finally the lady shows up without the pinata and she said sorry I forgot it at home. Do you want to buy a different pinata? They should have given us one for the inconvenience...Give me a break they strung us along the entire time and didn't even refund us our entire cost for the pinata. They refunded all of it except $3.75 which was their charge for running debt cards- what a rip off. Not that $3.75 is a big deal but we got ripped off, lied to, strung along, and left empty handed and pod for the hassle!!! I would never recommend them and hope you don't trust them with any event or party, they totally let us down and this was our big focal point of the party for the older kids attending. Everyone was let down and I can never get that back. It was my sons 1st birthday and it was really angering to receive such inconsiderate service and know that they don't care about ruining our event. Yes my son is one, but the pinata was for the older kids. Doing business like this, well they won't be around long. Buyer beware they are frauds!!!\"]\n",

      "[\"I dread Palace Station.  Mainly because I hate smoke and Palace, like most older casinos, reeks of smoke.  You can almost picture the rat pack smoking in front of every wall in the place.  So I was reluctant to eat here but our friends were staying here and we met them on their turf for dinner. \\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised.  The place was dead as it was Sunday but the food was good.  The chicken quesadilla really hit the spot and the buffalo chicken wedge salad was a hit.  Our waitress was cute and friendly and attentive. (maybe because we were one of three customers (I even forgive her transgression of KEEPING MY CHANGE).  \\n\\nA few notes:\\n1) Although an Irish Pub, very few items are authentic Irish meals, or even attempts thereon.  Basic Pub Food is what you should expect.\\n2) Although there are some TV's, not all of them are in direct view so if you come here to watch specific games make sure you sit in the center or pointed at the game you want.\\n3) The portions are large.  4 of us got out of there at 31 dollars plus tip for dinner.  We can't complain about that.\\n\\nIf I am at Palace meeting friends or playing poker, I would definitely eat here again.\", \"This bar is located in the palace station not far from the main entrance. Had so much fun here. Went a few different nights. One band was amazing, and even the band we thought wouldn't be very good turned out to be pretty awesome. Stay at palace station, play at palace station, but drink at Jacks.\", \"Hands down, this is the most disappointing Irish pub in Las Vegas.\\n\\nDad and I ate here at about 1PM on a Tuesday afternoon. There were a couple of people at the bar and one older couple sitting at another table. You'd think the service would be quick since the place was so empty, but it turned out the bartender was actually working as the server as well.\\n\\nWe ordered our food shortly after sitting down. Dad ordered a hamburger ($7.99) and I ordered 2 Scotch Eggs ($5) and a side of waffle fries. \\n\\n25-30 minutes later, a cook from the kitchen came out with Dad's hamburger from the kitchen and set it down on the end of the bar. Five to seven minutes later, the server brought the burger to our table...which by this time was cold. Ten minutes later, my food was brought to the table.\\n\\nThe food was NOT worth the wait at all! The hamburger resembled a hockey puck on its bun and wasn't even of a decent size, nor did it have any flavor to speak of. The Scotch Eggs were so crispy on the outside that they were unpleasant to eat, and barely tasted of sausage at all. The waffle fries were the only item that tasted very good...and even then, they were probably the same ones that can be found in any frozen aisle.\\n\\nAbsolutely NOT worth visiting! Horrible service and terrible food!\", 'The weather for St Patty\\'s 2012 was pretty lousy.  We had fully intended on going the Three Angry Wives after work but decided anything to do with standing outside in the cold with people who had been drinking since 11am was a bad idea.  \\n\\nI didn\\'t want to pay a $20 cover to go to McMullen\\'s where the police also conveniently placed a sobriety check right in front of.  So enter the ever dependable \"search for Irish bars\" on Yelp mobile.  Jack\\'s Pub?  There\\'s an Irish bar in Palace Station?  I called them and they informed me of some of the specials they had on top of their current happy hour deals and it sounded like a plan.  When I asked the manager if it was crowded there, her response was \"It\\'s filling up.\" Translation: \"Plenty of seats!!\".\\n\\n$3 beers, half price on all appetizers and $8 plates of corned beef and cabbage!  That\\'s all they needed to say.  Decent food and atmosphere while watching my NCAA basketball brackets go down in flames.  They had a band setting up by the time we left and the place had filled in nicely but we were too full of Guinness to get rowdy.  \\n\\nThis is not a bad meal option if the Oyster Bar line is too long.', 'I was very discouraged by the condition and poor service I experienced at Jack\\'s Irish Pub.  \\n\\nI called ahead to ensure that I had the correct time for the availability of the St. Patrick\\'s Day menu.  I was told that it would be available from 11am-11pm.  I arrived well after 11am and was told by the gentleman behind the bar that he had no idea when the menu would be available.\\n\\nAfter waiting for about 10 minutes, I then went to the player\\'s club desk where someone contacted the food and beverage manager after another wait.  I was told that I should return to the restaurant to talk to the manager.  I walked the few step directly to the restaurant and was told that the manager had left and was \"in the middle of something\".\\n\\nI subsequently found out that they had rebooted the registers and the St. Patrick\\'s Day food menu was now available.  I ordered the corned beef and cabbage and my friend ordered the Irish stew.  \\n\\nWhile sitting at the table I noticed that there were sticky stains on the table.  I spoke to the bartender about it and she came over in a few minutes and gave the table a cursory wipe-down.  She remarked that no one had been at that table that day, so someone must have forgotten to wipe the table down the previous night.  No apology for the unsanitary conditions was offered.\\n\\nSubsequently, the stew was brought out by the same bartender.  She stopped before bringing it to the table and placed it at the service area of the bar and said that someone else would have to bring the stew to the table.  I don\\'t know why.  I was told that my corned beef and cabbage would be coming \"soon\".\\n\\nMy friend was eating the stew and the other the usual metal flatware, when the male bartender came to the table with a plastic spoon, fork, and napkin in a cellophane package.  He gave that to me.  I incredulously asked him, \"plastic utensils???\"  \"really???\".  He replied, yes, and explained that they had run out of flatware.  My friend and I were the only two diners in the whole place.  That was it for me.  I then left the restaurant, very disappointed with the entire experience.\\n\\nOh, and by the way, the whole time we were at the restaurant/bar, we were serenade with loud, Heavy Metal rock, courtesy of three video monitors around the room.  This was not the authentic or semi-authentic Irish, St. Patty\\'s Day experience I expected, nor was it close to the level of service I expect from a sit-down restaurant.', \"Biased-opinion because I know how this place is run. But I know that even if I didn't, I would probably feel the same, me being in. food&beverage . Only One girl serving on weekdays and some days are randomly busy. You can't expect ONE girl to give their undivided attention to specifically your needs if she has a room full of people who also are paying. It's not Her fault. But I get it, there are those couple girls who stand around, but Most of the girls hustle. The bartenders are also busy, and as they are the ones who make the drinks, the girls are on their time. I think most of the reviews for this establishment are too harsh.\\n\\nOkay I'm done ranting.\\n\\nGood prices on drafts from $3.50 to $4.75 depending on imported or domestic beers as well as if there is entertainment. It's pub food, and you get what you pay for. The Irish nachos are addicting as well as fish & chips. The burgers are large and good for the price. Bump it shots after purchase of a beer is $2, which includes Jameson, Jim beam, jack or sauza (which typically starts at $6 each). You can smoke, watch whatever game you would like with the 20 or so tvs around the room, and you could choose to sit at a high top or one of the many booths.\", 'The food is ok, but the service is terrible.  Seriously had a waitress hand us a pad of paper and tell us to take our own order and give it to her.   Not her fault, she was the only server in the place.   We have been there several times and it is always the same.   Very slow service because there is only one person working.', \"Headed here after work for a Happy Hour with friends. The place was deserted, but they have some good specials and their happy lasts until 8, score. \\n\\nWell drinks are $2 and there are some good beer specials as well. We ordered some bar grub as well, which is 50% off during happy hour. The food wasn't horrible. Pretty tasty for the price I feel. The only problem with this place is the service. It was horrible. Our waitress would disappear for long periods of time and it took about 30 minutes for any of our food items to come out. Refills were pretty hard to come by as well.  \\n\\nI noticed that the waitress was the only one in the entire establishment, but given the fact that there were so few patrons, I don't think that should account for the slow service. \\n\\nI've been on previous occasions and had better service, so I'm hoping that was a freak occurrence. I'd probably come back if I'm in the area again.\", 'Experience:  was supposed to meet some friends at the oyster bar, but the line was long and they were late, so we met here instead. \\n\\nFacility:  this is a nice place. It has u-shaped booth seating that could fit 4 folks comfortably and squeeze 5. There is a lot of high stool seating at the bar and an additional bar (without bartender) behind it. There were lots of TVs to watch sports and it had a comfortable casual atmosphere. \\n\\nService:  this is the main reason why I am giving this place 1 star.  There was 1 waitress serving the booths. But, please keep in mind that there was only one other table filled, so she was not busy.  She did come over and get my drink order pretty fast, but when my friends arrived she did not come for a while. We were ready to order some food, and she wasn\\'t around.  She kept goign to the back for long periods. One of two things is happening...either the management has her doing some food prep, which is poor management decision, since there is only one waitress, or she is doing things she shouldn\\'t be, and management probably has no clue.  Either way, it heavily affected our service.  \\nNow, here\\'s the worst part....I spilled my beer.  Ok, that\\'s bad, but not the worst...it\\'s coming...\\nSo, of course the waitress is no where to be found....I\\'m scrambling trying to keep it on the table wiping with the two cocktail napkins on the table, and apologizing to my friend for getting her wet...finally the waitress goes by and I wave her down and show her we spilled, apologized and asked for her help.  \\nShe leaves and takes forever to come back.  I finally got up, walked over to the bar and got my own napkins.  She did not know this, and when she came out from hiding in the back again, she walked over to the other table to help them.  Then she goes back to the back and comes out again, with at least a dish rag in her hand. BUT, she walks past our table AGAIN to the other table, and then finally comes back by to us and hands me the rag.  I was shocked!  I explained that I had spilled a beer and why wouldn\\'t she come back and help immediately.  Her response was \"the other table needed ranch.\"  Yep, that\\'s what she said!  I did not get her name, but she was a blonde lady with a heavy accent.  Steer clear if she\\'s working!!! \\n\\nFood:  we ordered the Irish nachos, which were typical bar food...good, but nothing special.  Then we got the fish and chips. The fries were not overdone to the eye...a nice golden brown, but they were kinda hard when you bit them.  The fish had too much batter and flavorless.  I might get the nachos again, but would never order the fish and chips again. But that would mean I would come back p, and I never plan on doing that, unless they change their staff. \\n\\nOverall:  in the less than a year time I have been posting, this is my 111th review, and I have only given one other 1 star, so I don\\'t give them lightly.  They really need to retrain that waitress, or just get rid of her. I won\\'t be back to eat.  Might come back with friends to grab a beer at the bar.', \"We've been here several times before and have had great service . This time ? Yeah WTF? The waitress couldn't be bothered to even acknowledge us . If it had been busy I get it but not even close . Epic fail . Very disappointed .\", \"at Palace @stationcasinos on St Patricks Day for Corned Beef,Cabbage, Red Potaotes and a Pint for $12.\\n\\nThis bar REALLY gets to rocking with LIVE entertainment and HOT waitresses dressed in SHORT plaid skirts.\\n\\nGreat Beer Specials and the food wasn't half bad either!! The corned beef was good a little dry but good, the potatos slightly hard and undercooked and the cabbage JUST right. Overall all tasty enough for this Irish tradition and it didn't hurt it cam with a PINT:)\", 'So came here cause we saw as an \"announcement\" on yelp from the oyster bar that if u bring ur receipt u get 2 for 1 pints.  We walked in and immediately the bald bartender was a DICK and said he had never heard of it: I showed him the yelp announcement and he still acted like a prick, he even pretended to call his manager and was still unable to give us the deal. I guess there was a reason the place was dead! The female bartender was cute and wanted to help but unfortunately the bald guy called the shots.', 'If anyone goes to Palace Station I highly recommend seeing Samantha as she is a top notch bartender. Friendly, honest, quick service, helpful with info. And all around good bartender if ya wanna get piss drunk and talk shit. \\n\\n\"CAT\" ON THE OTHER HAND was horribly rude to my Australian friend and even though he was not intoxicated, or rude, was gambling consistently, she said he wasn\\'t getting another drink because he wasn\\'t \"gambling enough\" even though he had been there talking with another waitress for over and hour, and was told he we wasn\\'t gambling \"progressively enough\" and even went out of her way to be confrontational. To the point of making him feel like a cheap piece of shit. And ultimately leave the bar. He is a nonconfrontational person, and tips well. I even told Cat she set back relations between our countries  50yrs.', 'Joke. Sat at hightop just behind the bar for about 20 minutes and had zero interaction with staff. Left without ordering anything. One waitress and one bartender both of which were nonexistent.', 'Not our typical place we would go to, but we had to meet some friends here and they were late, so we decided to check it out based on a sign we saw for Happy Hour.\\n\\nIt was dimly lit and basically seat yourself, so we found a booth near the back. The waitress came over and I complimented her on her outfit ( schoolgirl plaid skirt and top ) she was quite friendly. \\n\\nThey had 2$ well drinks on special, so I ordered a gin & pineapple. \\nWe also ordered nachos and chicken wings which were only 5$ each during Happy Hour. \\n\\nThe food arrived fairly quickly, and we were really impressed with it for the price. It was so good ! We had a few more drinks and then got the bill. \\n\\nIt was under 25$ for everything. One of the least expensive meals, and one of the better tasting ones. I guess when you go in with low expectations, you can be pleasantly surprised.', \"Friday night at a Irish pub, drinking Irish brew, and listening to Irish band awesome. Jack's is a good place have some fun. Enjoy the Vegas bar pub scene with some good people and not crowded to the point your bumping elbows with everyone around you. Darby O'Gill & The Little People who usually plays here Friday nights was pretty catchy band. \\n\\nForgot what I was drinking but it was reasonably prices. I loved the atmosphere and decorations. I didn't try their food but I'm sure they have some corned beef cabbage, maybe next time I'm there.\", \"After going to see a show at Palace Station that wasn't actually happening the night we went, my husband and I stopped into Jack's Irish Pub with his brother for some drinks and a bite to eat. \\n\\nThe guys wanted a beer, and $12 gets you a 50 oz. glass of beer, and you get to keep the glass. Refills are $6 each, making this deal a no-brainer!\\n\\nWe also had some sliders and potato skins.... All food was $5 and you could taste why. Go for the beer, skip the food.\", 'Its supper dissapointing. We just to go there cause we have station casino card. And it became our favorite spot for my husbands day off. We loved the happy hour and the food. Our favorite bartenders were Neil and Ian. One time we were playing on the machines from the bar one for each of us. That afternoon was Sergio behind the bar, constantly ignoring us and being rude. At the end we ask for the check and they had charged us the complimentary drinks that it supposed to give us from the tickets they give you from the sports book. Full price, they even wont respect the happy hour prices. We had to tell the manager and then he fix the situation.that time we were showing a friend the place. He was like id rather go to the orleans on monday football.', \"The last time I went to Vegas, I stayed at the Palace Station because the hubs loves the Oyster Bar (You MUST go!) and I got a great deal and the room which was really nice.\\n\\nAnyway, while exploring the hotel we stumbled across Jack's.\\n\\nHummm....Love this place.\\n\\nThe bar had video machines there, so played some video poker and got free drinks - and we're not talking watered down ones  :-)\\n\\nI've been  into Vodka lately..... well, they just happened to have a nice selection and the bartender gave me samples of each along with  some details about all of them.

      "['This is a medium sized all you can eat sushi and Asian food buffet.  We went during \"Happy Hour\" where the price is only $11.95 per adult.  Possibly there are regular menu items that we missed by coming in an off peak time, but I doubt we will go back to find out.\\n\\nAlthough we like these kinds of restaurants, especially O Nami in San Diego, this is a poor representation.  The sushi is somewhat fresh, but the fish pieces are too large to eat in one bite and the rice quite small, it was an awkward eating experience.  I particularly dislike combo sushis without any labeling and there was none here.  There are also some hot dishes, such as soups, stir fries, fried noodles, and tempura shrimp and vegetables.  These were not bad, but not worth recommending.  The one thing that probably keeps people coming back is the chocolate fountain, which we are not particularly fond of.  The rest of the desserts are forgettable.\\n\\nBut the one thing that will definitely keep me away was the MSG headache I got less than hour after eating there.  It\\'s been years since I had to worry about this food additive.  Although my headache was not bad, I don\\'t need this experience again.  Go only if MSG doesn\\'t bother you.', 'Closed down a while ago and is now an Italian restaurant.', \"This place would have gotten a 5 star, but they got rid of their Happy Hour prices!  But still not bad for $13.95 per person.  Went on a Sunday for lunch.  The food was great that day, the last time I was there the consistency wasn't the same.  My main love in that place....the sukiyaki beef!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fatty beef with the broth, simmering with onions and tofu and cabbage.  Getting hungry just thinking about it!  I could eat plates of it over some rice.\\n\\nTheir sushi is normal fare, lots of California type rolls...some with roe on top, some with avocado, and even some with eel on top.  Their best sushi bet is the hand rolls (you have to ask to have them made).  They come out the freshest and taste the best.  For you beginners, go with the California hand roll.  Me, I like the spicy tuna.\\n\\nLunch that day had a good menu, of course the usuals like fried rice, noodles and tempura.  But they actually had fried oysters that day for lunch too which was unusual because I usually only see them during dinner.  Needless to say, the gf had like 2 dozen of em' because she loves her oysters  (heh heh...good for the libido too *wink**wink*).\\n\\nI wish they didn't charge for drinks, but their peach iced tea (I think it's peach) is really refreshing.  Just ask for iced tea, and it already comes that way.  Their dessert selection for lunch wasn't bad, some strawberry shortcake, some cheesecake, a green tea cake, couple other things I can't remember, and fruit with the chocolate fondue fountain.  They also had the shave ice machine going that day and ice cream too.  My favs are the shave ice with strawberry, and I like the red bean ice cream.  For you folks from Hawaii, ask for a scoop of vanilla ice cream in your bowl before the shave ice goes in there....almost like home!\\n\\nThis one is the nicest Makino's in LV, too bad the other new one in Summerlin had to close down.  The decor isn't so 'cafeteria' like the other 2 locations.  I still go here for lunch if I need a sushi fix on the weekends.\", \"Would get a 5 star, except for the nighttime price. When we first went there, the prices were not clearly posted. The food was excellent and the nighttime selection is very good, complete with a dessert buffet that does Creme Broulet and a chocolate fountain.\\n\\nThey also lose points for charging for drinks. Very few buffets in the Vegas Valley do this, because it's extremely bad business. \\n\\n--\\n\\nWe did try this again a second time for their Happy Hour. The selection was not nearly as good, however the food quality was still good. There were a few very rude customers in there, including a pregnant woman berating a chef for refusing to make her specialty food (HELLO!?! This is a buffet, not a regular restaurant. You take what's offered.) and management refusing to remove the rude customers... Unfortunate, but I may return once they have all their bugs worked out.\", \"Went here for a birthday last month and being tired of the minimal sushi at the buffets on the strip this place was the sh%%t if you love sushi.\\n\\nEven if you had 2 of each piece and had minimal helpings on the tempura and other stuff, you'd still be stuffed.\\n\\nWe got around 6 and I am not sure when dinner started but everything looked and tasted pretty fresh.  I tasted almost all of the rolls and sashimi but couldn't complain on any of them.\\n\\nI didn't try to much of their other stuff as I wanted to get full off the fish but did try the tempura which was good as well.  I did however take a bite of the bacon wrapped meat but didn't finish the whole piece.  \\n\\nFinished it off with the shave ice.   I wanted to go back when I went back to LV a couple of weeks after but didn't have the time.  Definitely going back the next time.\\n\\nIf you are a sushi lover and not a sushi snob that would look down at buffet sushi, this place is for you.\", 'of all the makinos in vegas, this is my least favorite food wise... which is sad, seeing that its the closest to my house and is the newest (building wise) to the other ones.\\n\\n- decor is fresh, with hints of traditional japanese or asian tones\\n- the restaurant has a more breathable feel than the other makinos, so it doesnt feel as cramped or crowded\\n- the wait staff and owner (ben) are very nice people\\n- plenty of parking in the lot\\n- relative cheap sushi buffet by vegas standards\\n- i am in love with BEEF SUKIYAKI\\n\\nok heres where it hurts - \\n- the food menu is lackluster at best... im used to seeing creative and special rolls at makinos... but this sushi bar was boring (cali rolls, philly rolls, rainbow rolls, spicy tuna)\\n- where is the sashimi? instead, i had to collect the nigiri and ditch the rice (what a waste of rice)\\n- hot food was just as boring... chicken teriyaki, crab cake, tempura...\\n- the cooks and sushi chefs seemed uninspired, and when i asked which foods are what, it was generally an \"i dont know\" answer - wrong answer in my book.\\n\\nif you want all you can eat sushi in green valley / silverado ranch; go to sushimon instead... and if you insist in makinos - do the one on decataur, the food is better....', \"All you can eat sushi buffet.  Huge variety of sushi, plus crab legs and shrimp cocktails, 2 different kinds of soups, and a mini buffet.\\n\\nFantastic quality, very clean (bathrooms) and spacious seating all for $30.  The only reason why I didn't give this a 4 star rating is because you can probably pay an extra $10 for Bellagio/Wynn buffet...but if you love sushi and want to avoid crowds in the casinos this is the place for you!\\n\\nI also like this place for 2 other reasons:\\n1.  Very very very cute Japanese waitress that I couldn't stop drooling over.\\n\\n2.  I didn't have to pay because of credit card roulette  :)\"]\n",

      "['place is ok. took my son and one of his teammates for a late lunch. i got the corned beef sandwich. it was ok, had much better. the bread was too soft. but the sandwich was a good size. my son and his teammate got pizza, have to admit it was pretty good. the fries were good. overall it was ok.', \"Placed a couple bets at the Sports Book and decided to grab a bite. Turned around and there it was. They got a good selection of eats from pastries to pizza. \\n\\nWhat caught my eye was the Corned Beef Sandwich. I saw the deli slicer and the big solid chunk of meat and I love Real Corned Beef, especially from a Deli. So, I ordered a Whole order of Corned Beef plain with White Toasted Bread. I like mine with Mustard and Mayo never hurt (they got a get it yourself condiment table to add what you want). \\n\\nThe Corned Beef sandwich was stuffed like 2 inches thick and the toothpick was holding on to dear life to keep it from bursting open. It was exactly what I was craving for. I held off from the mustard and mayo and took a bite as I couldn't wait no longer. Yup, it is was the Real Deal, Corned Beef at its Finest! I may mix it up a bit and try it with their Pastrami next time around..\", \"This place is getting 5 stars from me strictly for the pastries! Their pastries are amazing and huge!! I've been here about 5 times within the past two weeks strictly for the pastries. First off let me tell you I LOVE black and white cookies and their black and white cookies are amazing, basically a flat yellow cake with chocolate and vanilla frosting. They are soft and fluffy and so very tasty. They have a nice assortment of cookies, cakes, cheesecakes, a recreated hostess cupcake, brownies, and a bunch of other goodies. The other day I stopped by and got a cheese danish and a bagel with cream cheese for my fiancé, we love bagels. The cheese danish was great and again HUGE! The bagel with cream cheese was also very good and fresh. They also have rainbow cookies which I don't think I've ever seen anywhere before but it's more like a small piece of cake layered with chocolate frosting and strawberry jam (may of been raspberry) pistachio cake, strawberry cake and vanilla cake, it was an interesting dessert and very good and soft. I have yet to venture in to their actual food yet but their pastrami looks amazing. They have all kinds of stuff from pizza to matzo ball soup. I plan on trying their chicken wings and pastrami soon, if you are ever inside the south point hotel and casino stop by for some very very reasonably priced sweet treats.\", \"I wish I knew about this place sooner. They serve the same amazing bagels you'll find at the Bagel Cafe in Summerlin, and a selection of the same menu items, including some ridiculously huge and decadent desserts, the best of which are the tiramisu and strawberry shortcake.\\n\\nBut for me, it's all about the bagels. Big, round, soft, crusty bagels teeming with toppings. They're the best in town. Good bagels are hard to find in Vegas, but these could stand up to the competition in New Jersey. I don't give many higher recommendations than that.\", \"We love Bagel Cafe and often drive from Henderson to the other side of Vegas for the delicious bagels and sandwiches. While Del Mar Deli is part of the same family, it was markedly under our expectations. Bagels were still very well done, but not prepared as well. As well the atmosphere was not to our liking - just off the sports book in the casino isn't exactly a great place for a family breakfast. I think for those staying in the hotel or doing a quick take out this can work. Otherwise it is worth going to Summerlin.\", 'I had the pastrami sandwich.  The pastrami is very bland, no taste to it.  I am Jewish have eaten in NY  style delis all over the US.  Bagelmania  on East Twain has much better pastrami.', \"My second time eating here and it was good. Tonight we had turkey clubs. Very good and the sandwich was huge! $12 for the sandwich and potato salad. Little pricey for a club sandwich. Only negative besides price was the potato salad. I didn't care for it cause it was mustard potato salad.\", 'Awsome!!!! Why wait in line at steak and shake when this gem is hidden in the corner.', \"Ah man one star is pushing it. I was waiting in line knowing that the food I was going to get wasnt worth the wait. \\n\\nThere's really nothing wrong with the people that work there. The issue is that there is one cash register and one person taking your order.  Meanwhile there are 5000 guys in the back cooking the meals. They really need to open another register up. The food was eh but I wasn't expecting anything much  more. \\n\\nSo one star for the bottleneck place.\", 'WHY DOES THIS PLACE HAVE 3.5 STARS???  \\n\\nWHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TERRIBLE LIE???\\n\\nSandwiches were BLAND, as in, NO FLAVOR on the meat, NONE!  We both experienced this at different times, so pretty accurate.  At least the meat was tender and served hot (although microwaved).  \\n\\nOn another day....  I tried the strawberry shortcake, which was lacking strawberries.  I finally found one and it tasted like over-ripe, almost rotten, squishy strawberries taste when they should be thrown out!!  I returned the huge slice and got yelled at then had money basically thrown at me, haha,  How is it MY FAULT that you chose to use old strawberries and my taste buds caught you??  Oh well.  To the wrinkled, bleach-blonde, Aqua Net Queen:  Sorry I ruined your day.', \"Good sandwich.  Not great.  For one thing, they got the order wrong.  I ordered a pastrami rueben and got a plain pastrami.  I ordered it to go so I did not realize the error until I got back to my hotel room.  The pastrami sandwich was huge, but aside from the generous portion, it was not that great.  Just ok.  It came with coleslaw and a pickle.  I actually enjoyed the coleslaw and pickle more than the sandwich, if that tells you anything.  Probably would not go back.  It's not cheap.  The sandwich set me back about $12 bucks.\", \"As a local I stop into the Del Mar Deli frequently.  Their sandwiches are amazing, HOWEVER, the down side to this place is mind blowing.  The girl(s) at the counter run around like chickens with their heads cut off.  You stand in line which seems like a life time because they are so freaking slow and disorganized.  Half the time, even when it isn't a lunatic mess they get your order wrong.  How difficult can this be?  They should NOT be chatting with the food preparers, BUT should be JUST  taking the orders. Believe me IF this were my establishment and this nonsense went on.....and it is constant...They would be out the door.  I ordered a chicken salad sandwich on rye, NOT White, 4 bagels and some cream to go...I was the only one in line and LAURA still got it wrong.  Come on people.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to do this job!!  You NEED to watch when they make your order.  It isn't the preparers fault, it is the num-nuts behind the counter!!!  Where is management????\", \"I love hot dogs.  They have a giant footlong that they grill and bonus it's cut in half on a toasted yet soft bun, so delicious. I spent the extra money to have a side of fries instead of chips and it was worth it. I also had a slice of their giant strawberry cheesecakes. I had zero expectations I just needed something fast and easy and this place surprised me!\", 'Do not eat here!!! I just witnessed a cook that works here did NOT wash his hands after using the restroom. Again do NOT eat here!!!', 'This trip is my first visit to South Point.  Deli was reasonably priced for a sandwich shop in the hotel.  Pastrami was really good.  Half sandwich was $7.50 and a full sandwich was $9.95.  My 6 year old daughter enjoyed the pizza and my 4 year old tried his best to finish the monstrous hot dog.  I would definitely go here again.  You also get free refills on your soda.', 'Best corned beef ever!!!!!! My go to deli in town when I want some delicious bagels and corned beef. Small deli that packs a punch. Just look at the desert case and stare away at heaven.', 'This place Hit Rock Bottom and SANK FASTER THAN THE TITANIC!! The food is AWFUL, WHAT HAPPENED?? ITS SALTY & DRY AS SANDPAPER ! LOTS OF NEW HELP ! Mistakes galore, the help is too busy leaning over The counter watching sports in the RACE BOOK, ignoring customers, not paying attention to their jobs. Went in ordered 4 chicken matzo ball soups, bagels, 2 brisket of beef sandwiches, several desserts, 2 corn beef & 2 pastrami sandwiches, ALL TO GO ! Their was NO CHICKEN in the Matzo ball soups, They forgot the Bagels, they forgot the potato salad, the Cole slaw was funky looking and dark, little taste, the matzo ball soups where VERY SALTY and NO CHICKEN!!  Next visit went back and told them, they gave us the bagels, and Other Customers along with us, complained the bagels where STALE and HARD ! New help also watching the sports, NOT PAYING ATTENTION to their jobs or helping hungry customers.TERRIBLE FOOD QUALITY, lousy customer service. Place went down faster than the Titanic!! NEEDS NEW MANAGEMENT! THE CATS AWAY & THE MICE ARE PLAYING ! LOW QUALITY FOOD! NO SUPERVISION ! The HELP is too busy playing and Watching SPORTS & NOT paying attention to their jobs! Everyone suffers from a lack of caring and lack of quality food! Low standards showing, it speaks volumes! FOOD IS NOW HORRIBLE ! FOOD & Service SUCKS! \"NO SUPERVISION\"! SPORTS MORE IMPORTANT, TAKES PRIORITY OVER CUSTOMER SERVICE ! POORLY RUN ! FOOD QUALITY GONE WAY DOWN ! GO ELSEWHERE !!', \"Omg!! Fat kid heaven!! Huge portions!! I understand, its inside of a casino, People don't want eat, when they do, they're hungry..Roast beef piled up to the sky. cake portions bigger than most whole cakes. I do like the fresh bagels and lox. It's hard to find that in most places. If you get lucky, you can grab good table to watch the game and get beers too. Split your order, or get doggie bag. Or be a fat ass, eat the hole thing..Lol\", \"Well , many of the previous reviews were spot on . The food was good enough but took a long time and the order was incorrect as many stated was a problem , ordered two pieces of pepperoni pizza , the cashier repeated it back to me . 20 minutes later my order was up , two pieces of cheese pizza , told the lady I ordered pepperoni and she just shrugged , no offer to correct or anything as if to say , deal with it , which I did . Everything on the shelves such as bagels and pastrys looked good enough but it's hit or miss on order accuracy best I can tell &  kind of slow as well . For me I'll select another option next time . \\n Food service is hard , we all know this , but tighten up your game Del Mar , you are better than this !!!!\", \"The bagels are so fresh and the bacon is delicious. Coffee not so good. I have visited twice this week for the bagels and bacon. I had my bagels toasted with butter and jelly. I will definitely return. Customer service is good and they keep their dining area clean and in order. The bagels and bacon get the five stars and I bought my coffee from Seattle's Best Coffee around the corner on my second day visit.\", 'We arrived late on our first night in Las Vegas so after checking in at the adjacent Grandview, we made the short walk to the South Point and picked up a couple of Bud Lites at one of the bars using funbook coupons and settled in this deli. Most everything at this restaurant is oversized so we decided to share a pastrami on rye that included a small side of potato salad and a pickle slice.  Though the pastrami was lean and bountiful, the sandwich was on the dry side. I used another funbook coupon good for 15% off.', 'Place went to shit.....overpriced as their bagel joint. Not sure if Frank retired, but that is likely a contributor. They used to buy good garlipper wings..some of the best. Now their wings are shite for $12 with a few celery/carrot sticks. Even the corned beef and pastrami...used to be cooked right in house....if it still is they are slacking on the storage. Used to be a go-to three times a week....never again.', 'This place used to be AWESOME.  It is sad to see a place go down hill.  I ordered a corned beef sandwich and a Lox sandwich to go.  When getting to my destination the corned beef sandwich had a lot less meat on it then it did the last time which in itself was still less then it used to be and the price is higher.  The rye bread is not your traditional rye anymore either, now it is a thicker softer kind of bread almost like a thick sourdiough so they can put less meat on the sandwich and still try to make it look good.  The Lox sandwich was very disappointing.  For the price they charge there should be enough lox to cover the bagel, instead there were only 3 very small pieces.  \\n\\nThis is NOT the place to go for lox and bagel.  You can get a MUCH better lox and bagel for a cheaper price at Einstien bagels or Sunrise Cafe on the East side and they will not try and rip you off.  \\n\\nI can understand raising your prices because things are more expensive, but to raise the price and lower the quality/quantity of your sandwiches that is just wrong.  Its hard enough to find a good deli in this town and just when you thought you had one, they make changes and it goes down hill. \\n\\nThis place used to offer a really good Lox Platter and now it is only a sandwich and once you add lettuce, tomatoe, and onion on your bagel, you cannot even taste the lox.  Higher prices, lower quality, equals less customers.  It is sad to have to lower the quaility of my review for this place.  I guess I have to resort to visiting other places which have lower prices and real rye bread, and who are not as stingy with the lox as this place has become.  I wish I did not have to write this, but it is what it is...', \"I LOVE the other location in Summerlin, but this one isn't the same. It's closer to our house and I was craving the roast beef sandwich. I ordered the exact same sandwich that I order at the Summerlin location, but the portions are legitimately half. There needs to be consistency. \\nThe boy friend ordered a lox bagel work salmon, but his tomatoes were pretty gross. I was still hungry afterwards and both of us are disappointed in the meal.\", \"While staying @ The Southpoint we ate here. I had a ruben sandwhich which was huge but did not have nearly enough dressing. The fries were pretty good. Hubby had a grilled cheese and it was not anything special..certainly not worth the price of it.\\nThe desserts are off the chain..huge..really huge! Didn't get one because the size scared me! LOL\\nAll and all it was ok..next time I will drive across the street for Capriotties!\", \"I was staying at the hotel and didn't feel like going down to the restaurant to eat waiting for the kids to get out of the pool. Ordered a turkey sandwich with the potato salad, the corn beef and the chicken salad. It was really really good and luckily had the coupon in the fun book that we were given during our stay so it definitely helped with the bill as it was a little pricey. Will definitely eat again if we stay here.\", 'Surprisingly good deli with great portions and large selection of meals.  We split a pastrami sandwich and it was excellent.  Highly recommend!  Too bad South Point smells like cigarettes :/', 'Sadly this was just \"ok\".  I have been here in the past and the food used to be amazing. The flavor of my Reuben sandwich was just non existent. Corned beef has a great flavor when properly prepared. This sandwich was just bland.\\n\\nWhile pricey I would have happily paid it for a sandwich with good flavor. \\n\\nThe saving grace (and reason this is getting any stars) DESSERT!! Their cheesecake slices were huge and very tasty! Check that part out', 'Their dessert portions are HUGE!!! 1 piece is enough for a family! No prices on them so you have to ask. Their flan was only OK, it was kinda hard and chewy. They have bagels and hot dogs that are cheap too.', 'I know I\\'ve had food from here before in the past but from what I can remember, someone always ordered and brought it to me when they were at the South Point Casino. I was here twice today, Christmas Day. Twice because I went out with my family to watch Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It was about 9 in the morning and we hadn\\'t had breakfast yet. We picked up our tickets last night and the girl at the ticket counter informed us that Christmas Day is their busiest day of the year, so we had to get there early if we wanted good seats and didn\\'t want to stand in line. Well, I mention it because that\\'s the only reason I would be at the casino at 9 in the morning. It was about 75 more minutes before the movie started so we decided to get some food. Compared to all our other options at this casino at this time, this was our best option. And to be quite honest, I\\'d choose this place over Coronado Cafe for breakfast and late night eats. \\n\\nFor breakfast, I ordered the foot long hot dog which is $3.95 and comes with a side of chips. You can add toppings if you like, and what\\'s awesome about this is  that they give you a good amount of it for no additional charge! Which at first I only expected sauerkraut and grilled onions because that\\'s what I heard when I ordered. So it was a nice surprise to find a huge side of sauerkraut, grilled onions and CHEESE on my hot dog. Unless I\\'m at a specialty hot dog joint, I don\\'t usually see cheese on hot dogs. \\n\\nI also tried a bite of the pastrami sandwich (on rye) which had a good portion of pastrami slices. It was tasty. \\n\\nThey also have a huge selection of self serve, pump style condiments against the wall near the dine in area. Mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, deli mustard, relish, hot sauce and more. I also liked the framed posters of old movies on the wall. \\n\\nAfter the movie, we decided to pick up some food to go. I decided to go with the Corned Beef Rueben. I love Reuben! That is my favorite sandwich at the deli, so I decided to try this one. Compared to others that I\\'ve had, the corned beef was thick and flavorful but I wish they grilled the whole sandwich more so the cheese would be a little more melted. Oh, and the menu shows that you can choose from cole slaw, potato salad or chips... but they have no problem substituting fries for your side! Just ask!\\n\\nOh and I can\\'t forget the DESSERTS. This is what first caught my eye as I walked up to the deli counter. Even though I\\'m not eating any desserts I can write about it to satisfy my former sweet tooth. And you can enjoy it for me :).  You should see them in person. My photos don\\'t do them justice. Each cake slice, brownie slice, cheesecake slice, tiramisu, cookies, muffins and almost all their desserts are HUGE. Each dessert is about 4-6 inches wide and about an inch thick. It can serve 2-3 people depending on your appetite for sweets. The only ones that were normal size were the chocolate covered strawberries and cannoli. \\n\\nWe also ordered the cheesecake with strawberries as well, but I had to hold myself back from trying it, as I\\'m watching my sugar intake (no diabetes for me.)   :( You don\\'t even know how sad it made me. It\\'s Christmas Day too. I don\\'t know why the dark side was tempting me to try it. I\\'ve had great willpower since I\\'ve started this no dessert thing. It could be because it\\'s the magical time of the year when there are beautiful sweets galore everywhere....smiling, twinkling, batting their eyelashes saying, \"Eat me. eat me. eat me. Just one bite, Michelle. It won\\'t kill you. Eeeeeeeat meeeee.\" \\n\\nBut The Force was strong in me today. I did not give in to the seduction of the cheesecake. Take that cheesecake! \\n\\nAll in all I can say I\\'ll be back again.', \"Let me preface this by saying I went here on 7/30/10\\n\\nThis place is off of the freaking chain. I was here with the radio station I intern at and we ate at this place. I don't know what everything cost and I didn't have a meal but my sister and I split a piece of HUGE caramel topped cheesecake. It was so ridiculously good - probably the best I've ever had in my life. I am a cheesecake connoisseur and I can say that it was handsdown, the best cheesecake ever. Forget Cheesecake Factory, Juniors, whatever - this place has cheesecake on lock.\", \"We were checking out the new areas of South Point, as we were going to see a movie here (Scott Pilgrim) and wanted to see if the Steak n Shake was open yet, but it wasn't.  Instead, we found a bar and deli we had never seen here before.\\n\\nWhat really made the deli stand out was the amount of insane looking desserts they had, nothing I had seen since my own family's bakeries when I was little.  It all looked fresh and homemade.\\n\\nMy husband and I shared a half corned beef on rye, a small bowl of matzo ball soup, and a piece of strawberry cheesecake.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The corned beef was as good as Carnegie for a fraction of the price.  The matzo ball soup, dare I say, was better than the matzo ball soup from Weiss Deli.  And the cheesecake was new york style, and light, fluffy, with some of the biggest, most fresh strawberries.  \\n\\nThis deli not only blows away all the other casino sports book deli's I have been to but is better than probably most of the other deli's in town.\", \"Loved this place during our stay a South Point, ate here every day during our stay!  I would have given this place 5 stars except they don't have avocado... weird for a sandwich place to NOT have avocado (first-world problems, I know, I know).

Del mar deli is a must if you are anywhere near the south point hotel and casino.', \"French fries and desserts!\\n\\nIt seems every time I come to South Point Casino I always end up getting french fries from here and some type of dessert. The food is good, I had a corn dog once and I liked it.\\n\\nI just don;t like how slow they are especially when it's busy.\", \"Food = 3-4 stars\\nService = 1-2\\nOverall good food, but why is the lady at the register SO SLOW!!!

The deli seem to be a perfect choice. You place your order at the counter.  When the food is ready they call your number and you carry it to a small  area of tables just off of the Sportsbook. Not exactly romantic dining, but this is a small Deli in a casino. Being in the mood for something really decadent, my wife and I decided to share a pastrami reuben sandwich on rye. It came with a side of french fries. The sandwich was huge. Even sharing, it was a lot to eat. The pastrami was delicious and the Reuben was extremely well made. And the fries were also quite good. They were coated with something that enhanced the flavor. The biggest negative was the price. $13 for Reuben sandwich without table-service seemed to be a little steep ( about the same price I would expect to pay at a deli that has sit down table service).', \"Stopped in here on vacation based on reviews. Place is very friendly and food was great! Frosted flake pancakes were good and the pot of bread was cute. I will surely stop by again next time I'm in town and recommend to all.\", \"I've eaten here at least twenty times.  It is one of my favorite delis.  The daily specials are usually a half sandwich and a bowl of soup.  The half is as big as a normal whole sandwich.  The quality is always top notch and the prices are quite reasonable.  I haven't tried any of the enormous desserts, but the sandwiches and soups are terrific!\", 'Always eat at Del Mar deli while staying either at South Point or anywhere else in LV.  Fantastic bagels and very decent black and white cookies.  Actually their daily specials are a good value.  A hidden gem in LV.', 'Stopped in for breakfast on the way to the strip. We ordered a tuna melt and a bagel with cream cheese. To me their prices are a little high given they are just sandwiches. However, they are very tasty. The tuna melt was delicious and the bagel had an appropriate amount of cream cheese put on. The bagel could have been toasted a bit longer. Also the white bread they provide has seeds on the outside which I found weird. Not used to that. \\n\\nIt took almost 10-15 minutes for us to get our order and no one called out the order. We had to walk up to the counter and remind the staff that we had not received our food. I would recommend a little more organization and communication to accommodate the large amount of guests and orders that come to this deli.', \"This place is for those who want To skim on breakfast.  I didn't realize it was inside a casino instead of a standalone restaurant.  And the food were served on paper-type plate with flatware dispensed from a dispenser. \\n\\nThe lox and eggs were watery.  The hash browns does not belong on this menu. If you want hash browns, save your money to buy them at McDonalds. \\n\\nThe Yelp description should have more clear about this location.\", 'Del Mar Deli (located inside the South Point Hotel and Casino) is a good 3 star destination.  The lines can get long sometimes when waiting to place your order at the counter, but I enjoy looking at all the delicious looking baked goods in their display cases while waiting.   All the desserts are huge.  For the most part, they do not taste as good as they look though.  That is not to say they are bad.  They still taste good.  What is missing is the \"Wow\" factor.\\n\\nHonestly, I cannot recommend anything on their menu.  I just like going here because it\\'s a better choice than most other spots at South Point.  The wait isn\\'t too long, and you get a 15% discount if you are a hotel guest using their discount book.  I\\'ll continue to come here whenever we stay at South Point.  Maybe one of these days, I\\'ll try something that has that \"Wow\" factor!', \"So I should of expected a higher price due to it being in a casino so I am not going to complain about the food portion vs price. My sandwich was a philly steak it was ok but not worth the money. It tasted more like steakum meat then fresh steak. My husband paid 10 for a single cheeseburger and fries and the burger was a frozen patty and tasted like one. The cashier was very transactional which I find odd with this being a tourist town. I don't think I would order a meal from here again but I def want to try one of their deserts they looked fresh and tasty and the size is enough for two people. A suggestion too would be to get some cheesewiz for your cheesesteak it will help with the flavor. I don't mind paying more for food from casinos because that is the norm, I just don't like when I pay more and am not happy with my food.\", 'Ridonkulously GOOD! Had the Canola and the Caramel Cheesecake. All I can say is...DECADENCE. Oh and the hubs enjoyed a warm pretzel.', 'What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Unfortunately what rarely happens in Vegas, is a restaurant selling delicious New York style bagels that stay in Vegas. The closest that I have come to experiencing a New York style bagel in Las Vegas that tastes like the one I grew up with east of the Hudson River is the Bagel Cafe in Summerlin. I have a favorable opinion of Bagel Cafe. When I have shared my favorable opinion of Bagel Cafe with people, a few told me that they are affiliated with the Del Mar Deli in the South Point. For the past couple of years I had wanted to try Del Mar Deli. This morning, on the way to Red Rock Canyon I would make a detour to the South Point to give it a try. \\n  Del Mar Deli is located in the southeast corner of the South Point adjacent to the sports book and a few steps from Seattle\\'s Best. If you park in the parking garage, you will get exercise walking across the casino. That is a good thing because the bagels are large. \\n\\n  At the time that I arrived at Del Mar Deli, it was happening. This was at a time there was little action going on at the sports book. This gives me an impression that customers are going out of their way to eat here. When I waited in a line that moved fast, I looked at the sundry of choices on the above blue and white menu boards. My mind was set on a bagel sandwich. If my mind was set on something else there were hot dogs, pizza, burgers, sandwiches, and cases of pastries. If I was not set on the bagel I would order a pastry. These are humongous and delicious pastries that include chocolate chip cookies and the very hard to find in Vegas rainbow cookies. The pastries were identical to those of Bagel Cafe. As I waited in line, I glanced at the open kitchen. I failed to notice evidence of bagels being made fresh. This brings up the question, \"Are the bagels made fresh in the Bagel Cafe then delivered here?\" When it came my turn to order, I exchanged nearly $11 for a poppy seed lox bagel. Subsequently I would wait for them to call my number and present me with my food. \\n\\n   When I picked up my food, there was another wait on line before enjoying it in the moderate size dimly lit seating area overlooking the sports book area and deli counter. You would think that for $11 in a self serve restaurant that breakfast included coffee. That was not the case. Instead of chancing a couple more dollars on a cup of coffee that could be dumped in the trash, I walked a few steps to one of the remaining Seattle Bests in Vegas. The medium cup of Seattle\\'s Best added $2.40 to the breakfast. With the coffee and lox bagel, I brought it to one of the few vacant tables that faced a wall of pictures above a counter of condiments. \\n\\n  The lox sandwich came open. Lying flat the two halves of the poppy seed bagel held lox, tomato, onions, lettuce, and cream cheese. When I put the two halves together to form a sandwich, it was an impressive size. I was impressed by the size of the bagel at the same time that I would have appreciated more slices of lox. The bagel temperature was just right. Complimenting the lox bagel sandwich were half a pickle with Cole slaw. It would take around a half hour to savor the tastes of a New York style poppy seed bagel lox sandwich gradually disappearing from the to go box below. Of course, I would take advantage of the complimentary South Point WiFi to keep up with the news. \\n\\n   After dumping the nearly empty plastic plate, I walked across the South Point Casino with some thoughts on Del Mar Deli. Here are the thoughts. With an infinitesimal selection of Las Vegas bagel shops that can compete with a New York bagel shop east of the Hudson River, Del Mar would be my second favorite west of the Colorado River. Regardless how much I love a lox bagel sandwich I am aware that it is a treat to enjoy once in a while. As I wrap up this review I have a different thought to share. Here it is. Unexpectedly, it never dawned on me that this is the place to grab a pastry to go along with Seattle\\'s Best Coffee. The next time if I return to Del Mar Deli, I will try one of the delicious cookies in their display case . My closing thought: 4 Stars!', \"Working at Southpoint this ends up a monthly choice for us... There's definitely a couple things that are my go to menu items. \\nChicken salad sandwich on wheat with fries, the chicken salad is simple... Really simple but it's good and to the point and a huge portion as is everything at this place. \\nMatzo ball soup, they keep the matzo ball separate and not sitting in the soup so it's never soggy but isn't dry either. They use the same base for their chicken noodle soup and their matzo so if u like one the other is good too. Bagels are always fresh and their half soup half sandwich choices are always filling. The other choice is pastrami sandwiches, they shave the hot fresh pastrami and beefs when you order. I wish I knew the girls names that are helpful there are some more friendly than others but they are accommodating. Not social and flirty but still accommodating. Desserts- the eclair is my go to along with the black and white cookie and gluten free cookies. I've never had a bad dessert there but those are my favorites!\", \"I was craving breakfast for dinner so I ordered eggs with hash browns and sausage which sounded amazing. It tasted great but within a few hours I got sick and had a rather unpleasant experience.\\n\\nAll in all I'd go back since my date enjoyed her bagel with lox. I don't think I would get the eggs, hash browns and sausage.\\n\\nI'd probably go for a sandwich =)\\n\\nGood luck with your decision making!\", \"I can't comment on the other food at this place but the chicken finger meal is a joke. The chicken fingers were very dry and heavily breaded. The fries had a weird seasoning and was not good at all.\", \"Basically...just you're average deli in the middle of a casino.  Located inside the South Point near their sportbooks.  Review the menu and there's nothing you haven't tried before.  Plain and boring.  But for some odd reason, one of my favorite stops in Vegas.  My guilty pleasure.  If I'm south of the strip and am feeling like feeding, don't be suprised if I stop at valet and tell them I'll only be 10 minutes to pick up something from the deli.  \\n\\n-Fries:  One of the best.  Never greasy, just right.  Golden brown, just like how mom use to make it. \\n\\n-Calamari:  Not sure if this is regular item, but I have gotten it a couple of times. Just okay.\\n\\n-Whole Chicken w/Swiss on Wheat:  This is what I come here for.  Nothing special, just hits the spot for me and is the portions are healthy.  Try 14oz of chicken meat.  Have it plain and it's low carb and high protein.  \\n\\n-Corn Beef Sandwich:  Pretty damn good.  All you will taste is corn beef and forget the bread is even there. That's how big the serving is.  \\n\\n-Pizza:  Never a mistake.  Only a mistake if you are counting the calories. NY Style. \\n\\nYou have a choice to get the half sandwhich or whole sandwhich. The half sandwhich is really most places full sandwhich.  Keep in mind, a half chicken is about 7 oz of meat.  \\n\\nNow for their specialty.....the desserts.  You won't see the desserts on the menu, but cannot miss them because they are smack in your face.  In da face!!! I have tried the carrot cake and the cheesecake.  Each slice is about 6 inches thick.  Not a typo...really big especially for a deli.  One of the best cheesecakes out here.  Yes, I said it.  You can wash their desserts down with the shakes from Steak N Shake (hang a left from this place and a dogleg right, can't miss it).  My only issue...plastic silverware.  Believe me, there's difference in taste when you eat desserts with metal silverware, keeps the coolness.  trust me, I know what I'm talking about. \\n\\nGot Desserts on Steroids??? They do!!!\", '1. We had just completed watching a show in one of the showrooms and wanted to eat something short of a buffet and found Del Mar Deli.\\n\\n2. The food was simply average in taste. The veggie omelet was normal. The pastrami sandwich was average.\\n\\n3. The prices were above average - somewhat strange for a deli in a quasi-local hotel and casino front area. Our bill was $27.84.\\n\\n4. The eating area and condiments were a duplicate of the Costco set-up, notably the self serve packets, forks, et cetera. And definitely not comfortable but then again that is not what a deli is about. \\n\\n5. The service was only available at the ordering counter and nowhere else.\\n\\n6. I think it is good for the adjacent sports book but not as a destination.', 'Good Sandwiches and Great Desserts. Great place to pick up a Huge dessert to take home for a couple of people to share.', 'Had two meals here in the last two days. First I had a jalapeño cheese bagel with bacon, egg and provolone. It was delicious... Next day I came and had a corned beef sandwich on rye with a potato salad... Very happy with the food quality, and value for the price I paid. Would definitely come back for another visit when I come back in town....', 'I have to say the older ladies taking your order are usually really nice and awesome!  Great attitude from the older ladies, the young girls not so much.', 'Strawberry cheesecake is huge!!! And absolutely amazing!!! $6 and its a smoking deal', 'I was staying at South Point for a couple of days earlier this week and was looking for something to eat at around 10:45AM. I really wanted to try Steak \\'n Shake, and decided to pass on Del Mar Deli and wait for S\\'NS to open. I mentioned this to my good friend Jay F. later that day and he said \"Dude, Del Mar Deli is legit\" and claimed they had the best bagels in Vegas, and better than the beloved Bodo\\'s Bagels from our college days in Charlottesville (UVa). Those are big words and a high recommendation coming from a NJ native. So we agreed that the next morning, when he was taking me to the airport, we would meet at Del Mar Cafe so I could see what all the fuss is about. \\n\\nThe fuss is well-deserved. I ordered a Bagel and Lox sandwich on an egg bagel (toasted) for breakfast. It seemed a bit pricy at $10, but the sandwich had a generous portion of lox and cream cheese, and the bagel was oh so good. \\n\\nSandwiches here also looked amazing, with nice large portions of meat, and the desserts were HUGE. The tiramisu was the size of your head - literally. If the rest of the food tastes as good as it looks - and as good as the bagel I had - then Del Mar Deli is definitely a winner.', 'Items Selected:\\nPecan Bar\\nBlack and White Cookie\\nCinnamon Roll\\n\\nOwned and operated by the team behind Bagel Café and serving a limited menu of items baked at the flagship plus a number of selections made on the premises of The South Point it was largely by accident that I stumbled upon Del Mar Deli but rarely in the area and with the Sportsbook in plain view I gave way to temptation, a twelve dollar trio proving every bit as impressive as the items up north.  Small in size and a bit drab in decor amidst the smoky locals casino it was to a short line of patrons and a smiling staff that I arrived at the Del Mar counter and watching the bakers work for a few minutes in order to determine what was fresh my order wrote itself - two items warm from the rack while the last was cut from a pan, wrapped, and saved for later...at least in theory.  New York Jewish in concept but apparently insufficiently kosher in its offerings as I overheard a young rabbi and his wife discussing their sandwiches it was with a springy hot cinnamon roll beneath rapidly melting icing that my tasting began and moving next to a saucer-sized black and white with modestly sweet frosting atop a delicate crumb my taste buds swooned, the half shared with my mother and aunt equally well received along with a dense pecan bar dipped in chocolate shell atop a butter crust that barely made it past the slot machines en route to the car.', \"Quick, high-quality sandwiches and other quick offerings.  The portions are generous and everything was high quality.

Was delicious and half turkey sandwich.  Came out quickly!   Better than the gross Buffett. How much can one eat anyway?!\", 'I got in line around 10am and the line was short but the closer you get to meal time there is a long line.  I ordered a turkey club and it was great.

Great place!', 'GREAT and FAST! A little chaotic, but delicious and took no time at all to be ready. The sandwich was HUGE and worth the seven bucks easy.', \"Best place to pick up a quick bite at South Point Hotel. My jalapeño bagel was fluffy and loaded with cream cheese. Bacon is nice but the hash browns are like McD's.\", 'This place was ok - not amazing bny means but fair.  The sandwhich was a little dry, but it was a good size.  This is the only place you can actually get Diet Coke (not pepsi) in the whole South Point Casino though so it gets a bump up for that.', 'OK deli sandwiches, but nothing special. Italian wedding soup was quite salty, but should please some of the smoker casino patrons.', 'Stopped by the place before catching a movie.

Was more than his sandwich cost, very nice if them.\\n\\n Eaten here several times, sandwiches are good as was the slice of pizza. Cheesecake was very good. A little pricey on things but portions are generous.\\n\\n Everyone working there has been cool. People tend to take things out in workers in casinos, I've noticed, and this place is no exception, I would imagine even the most enthusiastic employee would get jaded over time. Next to sports book, plenty of drunk idiots get hungry. Would recommend.\", \"My boyfriend and I stopped here for a quick bite while trying our luck at The South Point Casino. We were looking for something quick that wasn't a buffet or fast food. \\n\\nI ordered the French Dip with provolone cheese and a side of potato salad. The roast beef was very bland and disappointing for what you pay. My boyfriend stated that all the flavor from a French Dip comes from the au jus, but I have had much more mouthwatering sandwiches elsewhere. \\n\\nThe potato salad is where they saved themselves. At first glance, it seemed to be too yellow from too many hard boiled eggs, but the taste was divine. I think they may have soaked the potatoes in pickle juice which is a must for any great potato salad (in my opinion).

No smile from the cashier taking my order was my first impression . I ordered a pizza and other items as I had a comp from the South Point Hotel.\\nThe pizza was dry, short on pepperoni and I wasted a comp on this poor excuse for a pizza. My last pepperoni pizza from here was brought to me from an employee from SP and it was awesome.  I know he tipped in advance so now I wonder if the only way to get a good pizza is bribery . I usually tip as I have been in tip positions for many years. Having been in F and B business I foolishly assumed that I paid for the food that I ordered. I guess I should tip in advance at Del Mar Deli to get what I pay for', \"I had a couple slices of their pizza and I must say it was pretty good.  Their baked goods looked incredible too.

The only drawback are the prices, definitely on the higher side. \\n\\nMy personal favorite is the Everoast Chicken Sandwich (cold sandwich). The chicken has a ton of flavor, is moist, and the bread at Del Mar Deli is outstanding. They put enough meat on their sandwiches to make an extra sandwich or two. Also make sure they include a pickle. Also a fan of their cheeseburger. They do a great job of cooking it to the desired temperature - medium for me. Great flavor, comes with fries, definitely more than enough food.\\n\\nDuring football season be prepared to stand in a longer line.

Unfortunately, we ordered it with wheat bread toasted which turns out to be the driest bread.  Factor that with dry roasted turkey breast, no amount of mayo will make this sponge moist.  The pastrami's looked very good as does the desserts.  We just picked the wrong dish.  Next time, it's a fatty pastrami.

I like the gyro, a nice option to have in a casino.', 'Best chicken noodle soup anywhere. Pair it with a sesame bagel with whipped strawberry cream cheese, and you have a solid, filling meal for not a lot of money.', \"Deli food seems pretty fresh and overall good. I had the French Dip which I would have said was fabulous, had they not served me oil as au jus. I could tell before I dipped my sandwich that it was very oily, but gave it a dippin' anyway. My sandwich where I dipped it was clear and had no taste. I tried to take it back and get actual au jus and not all the oil from the meat. They could not get me any because all their au just was pure oil! So gross and so disappointing because the meat was very tender and sliced thin, just how I like it. And, it was served on a fresh roll. I would have given this place 5 stars! Get your au jus right! And, if you can't use the juices from the meat, then mix up some au jus with broth... No one wants to dip a sandwich in tasteless oil!\", 'It\\'s hit or miss and very expensive.\\nTried to order the 1/2 sandwich special with soup-\\nThey argued the price for 15 minutes as it was clearly shown as a special.\\n\\nAfter literally 20 minutes of computer problems and a long drawn out arguing of facts I gave up and said: \"I DON\\'T CARE, GIVE ME A DAMN SANDWICH AND SOUP\".\\n\\nThey obliged and charged me double, lol.\\n\\nI threw the other half away because I couldn\\'t eat the whole thing.\\n\\nThis place is just a necessary nightmare when you\\'re staying at South Point.\\n(South Point sucks too by the way). \\n\\nNOTE: The other staff is amazing, the cooks are smiling and put love into the overpriced food. So it almost makes it worth it.\\n\\nThe female manager is very caring and dissolves situations when she\\'s there.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s about it.', \"we were staying at South Point, and have eaten here twice before, and wow, when you order a meat sandwich, it is FULL of meat! so much that you are stuffed when done...for lighter eaters, I recommend the half sandwich...usually I order the toasted plain bagel with cream cheese..a huge bagel, slathered with a thick layer of cream cheese..mmmmm! so good for when you don't want a heavy meal in the evening....\\n\\nthis last time, decided to try the chicken matzo ball soup, that came with a choice of bagel and cream cheese, or other assorted sides...got the bagel with it....was thinking ok...a bowl of soup, how much can that be...well da-yum! it was a good size bowl of soup, and the matzo ball was literally the size of a baseball! when I got done eating it all,  I was over stuffed...delicious soup! next time, will get the soup and a salad...this place is definitely worth a try, and if staying at south point, there is a 15% discount coupon in the fun book...try it, you'll like it!\", \"While watching football last weekend, we decided to get some breakfast sandwiches.  The service is quick and efficient and the food is pretty decent, but damn they are SO expensive.  Two bagel breakfast sandwiches for $20!  It's quite steep.  I'm not gonna say it's worth it as you can get just as good of breakfast sandwiches from Einstein's for half the cost, but I guess if you're at South Point and want the convenience of not having to leave the casino, it's a good alternative.\", \"Well just ate there don't quite see all the rave.  Had a BLT, sandwich. Cold white toast, cold bacon,  not appetizing,  no mayo,  with lettuce and tomato. I threw out over half of it,  cold bacon you can keep it.  I asked at the counter they said that's how they serve it. I said ok.  Went to Steak and Shake, got a BLT with fries for half the price,  and  it was hot and was delicious.\", \"The first time I came here I thought it was a tourist trap with high prices compared to what you received. As you look at the desserts and pastries in the display case, they are massive (Claim Jumper) style. The sandwiches seems to have a pound of meat on them and are very filling. The Sports Book is my stomping ground and while in line you can see the giant screens in the book  and the smaller TV's around the the Sports Bar Lounge so I can stay up on the games I have. The lines can be pretty ridiculous during big sporting events (football sundays), if they only had fast passes for regulars! \\n\\n I have enjoyed  almost everything I have gotten here. The vegetables can at times lack flavor. They have everything from bagels to omelets to sandwiches and desserts.  Reminds me a lot of the quality of the Deli at the Rio when Marnell Sr. owned it long ago.  Worth checking out if you are in the area. There are Tv's all over here  where there are none in the cafe so this is a better option to dine if games are going on IMO.\", \"Expensive but you get what you pay for.\\nThey charge for everything including buttering your bread. Yeah, even that is extra.\\nTake a deep breath in line, that'll be another $1.\\n\\nGood bagels, good bread, good portions, good quality. You can split any meal on the menu.\\n1000 mile catatonic stares from the people taking your order and they may get it wrong so explain it fully, in detail.\\n\\nIf you want a salad, say the word 'salad' twice or it'll be a sandwich. \\nIt's a long, frustrating wait to get a wrong order corrected so make sure they are listening when you order, good chance they aren't.\\n\\nExcellent chili, excellent soups, excellent pastries, excellent sandwiches, it's all good.\\nNothing out of a box or can or pre-frozen. This is the real deal.\\n\\nGrab your wallet.\"]\n"

      "Nice, open bar with great views of the strip and golf course.  Patio seating also.  Nice happy hour prices.  Had the carnitas nachos...very good.  And they serve breakfast all day.  Not noisy or smoky We usually stop here after using the driving range. The place is very clean,including the restrooms. The food is good and the employees are friendly. The atmosphere is casual and relaxing. The view of the Strip is a plus.There are numerous TV's to watch sports.\n",
      "This would be a great place to watch the football games after hitting a bucket of balls. The first time we ate here everything was good.  Since that first we have tried it four more times.  The service and the food have been a big disappointment.  On the last visit I had to return my burger because it was not cooked.  When they brought it back it had an unusual odor but I ate it anyway.  Sick for three days.  Great location but we wont eat here again. So I took my daughter there for breakfast and some practice. Eaten at this place before and it was good. Service was decent.  Waitress says cooks not here he is late. I asked if she has apple juice and ice tea, apple juice for my daughter. She shot me a look and in a dismissive voice says we don't have any.  I said forget it and left. How bout ya don't open if you don't have a cook? How about you are at a driving range you need some kind of something for kids. Not all kids drink soda. Get it together, get some people who care. This restaurant has a new name it used to be called upper deck grill. Previous owner in restaurant was very friendly and have great menu. Staff and owner were very Golf friendly had great atmosphere and wonderful menu. New staff is not golf friendly and doesn't have same golf atmosphere. Taylor made should address this. Menu and prices are not as good as previous owners. Took way to long to get good and my appetizer came out with meal\n",
      "When I complained they just didn't respond. Happy hours 3-5pm. Beer started $3, buffalo wings with vegetable sticks & cheese $6.00. Good price with decent food. Nice view and actually you can seat at the patio site. Staffs are nice and very friendly. I saw some  tourist comes enjoying view and hang out at the range area.\n",
      "Atmosphere is clean and welcome to everyone even if you are not a golfer. After a cold round of golf we snuggled up to a great bowl of chili and the most amazing pb&j.  The fresh lemonade was crazy good.  If that wasn't enough to get you in the door, the service was extremely nice and attentive to the needs of my kids.  We look forward to trying breakfast soon. Service outstanding (Brenda and Jennifer). Braised pork with hot sweet pickles was yummy. Next to the Taylormade Golf Experience. Very enjoyable conversation and food. Awsome food ,great service. Great place to hang out & have a brew ! Really nice & helpful staff. Defiantly coming back. Beautiful golf course as well as an amazing breakfast before or after you play. Prices are incredibly reasonable, food is wonderful, and the staff is so friendly and attentive. If you're around this area, come grab breakfast or lunch!\n",
